   Abstract={Despite evidence of efficacy of antihypertensive agents in treating hypertensive patients, safety and efficacy of antihypertensive agents for coronary artery disease (CAD) have been discerned only from subgroup analyses in large trials.\\ To compare mortality and morbidity outcomes in patients with hypertension and CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS) or a non-calcium antagonist strategy (NCAS).\\ Randomized, open label, blinded end point study of 22 576 hypertensive CAD patients aged 50 years or older, which was conducted September 1997 to February 2003 at 862 sites in 14 countries.\\ Patients were randomly assigned to either CAS (verapamil sustained release) or NCAS (atenolol). Strategies specified dose and additional drug regimens. Trandolapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide was administered to achieve blood pressure goals according to guidelines from the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) of less than 140 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 90 mm Hg (diastolic); and less than 130 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 85 mm Hg (diastolic) if diabetes or renal impairment was present. Trandolapril was also recommended for patients with heart failure, diabetes, or renal impairment.\\ Primary: first occurrence of death (all cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; other: cardiovascular death, angina, adverse experiences, hospitalizations, and blood pressure control at 24 months.\\ At 24 months, in the CAS group, 6391 patients (81.5%) were taking verapamil sustained release; 4934 (62.9%) were taking trandolapril; and 3430 (43.7%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide. In the NCAS group, 6083 patients (77.5%) were taking atenolol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril. After a follow-up of 61 835 patient-years (mean, 2.7 years per patient), 2269 patients had a primary outcome event with no statistically significant difference between treatment strategies (9.93% in CAS and 10.17% in NCAS; relative risk [RR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.06). Two-year blood pressure control was similar between groups. The JNC VI blood pressure goals were achieved by 65.0% (systolic) and 88.5% (diastolic) of CAS and 64.0% (systolic) and 88.1% (diastolic) of NCAS patients. A total of 71.7% of CAS and 70.7% of NCAS patients achieved a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg.\\ The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy in hypertensive CAD patients.},

   Abstract={Limited data are available regarding the incidence of breast carcinoma among users of relatively recently introduced forms of antihypertensive therapy. Although it has been suggested that women who have taken calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have an increased risk and that women who have taken angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a decreased risk, currently, no conclusions can be drawn.\\ A population-based case-control study of women ages 65-79 years was conducted in western Washington State. The responses of 975 women who were diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma during 1997-1999 were compared with the responses of 1007 women in a control group. Associations between use of different types of antihypertensive medications and breast carcinoma incidence were evaluated using logistic regression.\\ Overall, women who had ever used CCBs, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors did not have an altered risk of breast carcinoma relative to women who had never used antihypertensive medications. Although the use of immediate-release CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics was associated with modestly increased risks of breast carcinoma (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0-2.1; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; and OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1, respectively), the absence of any trend in the size of excess risk with increasing duration or with current versus former use of these agents argues for a cautious interpretation.\\ The use of particular types of antihypertensive medications, including immediate-release CCBs and certain diuretics, may increase the risk of breast carcinoma among older women. Additional studies are warranted to clarify these potential associations. Cancer 2003;98:1504-13.},

   Abstract={Earlier angiographic studies have suggested that calcium antagonists may prevent the formation of new coronary lesions and the progression of minimal lesions. Conversely, a meta-analysis suggested that these drugs may increase cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease.\\ To investigate whether nisoldipine retards the progression of coronary atherosclerosis or reduces the occurrence of clinical events.\\ The NICOLE study (NIsoldipine in COronary artery disease in LEuven) is a single centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial with coronary angiography at baseline, six months, and three years of follow up.\\ 826 patients who had undergone successful coronary angioplasty were randomised to nisoldipine 40 mg once daily or placebo. The intention to treat and per protocol population consisted of 819 and 578 patients, respectively.\\ In the per protocol population, 625 of the nisoldipine treated and 655 of the placebo treated patients (NS) showed angiographic progression in at least one coronary arterial segment, defined as an increase in diameter stenosis of > or = 13%. The average minimum luminal diameter of the non-dilated lesions decreased by 0.163 mm and 0.167 mm in the nisoldipine and placebo groups, respectively (NS). The respective numbers of new lesions detected were 7 and 13 (NS). In the intention to treat population, the rates of death, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction were similar in both treatment groups. However, nisoldipine use was associated with fewer revascularisation procedures and thus the percentage of patients with any clinical event was lower (44.6% v 52.6%, p = 0.02).\\ Nisoldipine has no demonstrable effect on the angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but its use is associated with fewer revascularisation procedures.},

   Abstract={Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is controversial.\\ To determine whether initial therapy with controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease.\\ Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. A total of 16 602 participants diagnosed as having hypertension and who had 1 or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were enrolled between September 1996 and December 1998 and followed up until December 31, 2000. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up, the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results.\\ Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of COER verapamil and 8361 received either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs (eg, diuretic, beta-blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) could be added in specified sequence if needed.\\ First occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death.\\ Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 13.6 mm Hg and 7.8 mm Hg for participants assigned to the COER verapamil group and by 13.5 and 7.1 mm Hg for partcipants assigned to the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 364 primary cardiovascular disease-related events that occurred in the COER verapamil group vs 365 in atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.18; P =.77). For fatal or nonfatal stroke, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular disease-related death, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.37). The HR was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.16) for any prespecified cardiovascular disease-related event and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93-1.26) for all-cause mortality. Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common with participants in the COER-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.16-2.04]; P =.003). More cardiovascular disease-related events occurred between 6 AM and noon in both the COER verapamil (99/277) and atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (88/274) groups; HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.53).\\ The CONVINCE trial did not demonstrate equivalence of a COER verapamil-based antihypertensive regimen compared with a regimen beginning with a diuretic or beta-blocker. When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment.},

   Abstract={To investigate the impact of treatment on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, we assessed outcomes in patients with hypertension and diabetes who received co-amilozide or nifedipine in the International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension. Participants had to be 55 to 80 years of age, with hypertension (> or =150/95 or > or =160 mm Hg) and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients received 30 mg nifedipine once daily or co-amilozide (25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg amiloride) daily. Doses were doubled if target blood pressures (<140/90 mm Hg) were not achieved. Primary (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) and secondary outcomes (composite of primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality and death from vascular and nonvascular causes) were assessed by means of intent-to-treat analyses. There was no significant difference in the incidence of primary outcomes between nifedipine-treated and co-amilozide-treated patients with diabetes at baseline (n=1302) (8.3% versus 8.4%; relative risk, 0.99, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.42; P=1.00). A significant benefit for nifedipine-treated patients was seen for the composite secondary outcome (14.2% versus 18.7%; relative risk, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97; P=0.03). Among patients without diabetes at baseline (n=5019), there was a significant difference in the incidence of new diabetes (nifedipine 4.3% versus co-amilozide 5.6%, P=0.023). Nifedipine GITS once daily is as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications in hypertensive diabetics. Nifedipine-treated patients were also less likely to have diabetes or have secondary events (a composite of all-cause mortality, death from a vascular cause, and death from a nonvascular cause) than co-amilozide recipients. Our results suggest that nifedipine could be considered as first-line therapy for hypertensive diabetics.},

   Abstract={The association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCB) and cancer has received ample attention, but is still controversial. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the observed association between CCB and cancer in earlier studies could be explained by residual confounding or by misclassification of exposure because of the use of cross-sectional data on drug use. Data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study in the municipal area Ommoord, were used. The study population consisted of a cohort of 3204 participants aged 71 years or older who were followed from a baseline interview in the period 1991-1993 for the occurrence of incident cancer. Data on drug use were gathered at baseline and through the seven community pharmacies which served the Ommoord region during the study period between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 1999. Incident cancer events were gathered from a nationwide registry of hospitalisation data and from a specialised cancer centre in the Rotterdam region. We performed three analyses. First, we followed the method, and adjusted for the same risk factors, as in the earlier studies. In the second analysis, we included all risk factors that were univariately associated with cancer in the Rotterdam Study. In the third analysis, we included exposure to CCBs as time-varying co-variates, while adjusting for potential confounders. The relative risk (RR) of cancer associated with CCB was 1.4 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.9-2.0) in the first analysis and lowered to 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8-1.8) upon adjustment for the different co-variates in the second. In both analyses, however, verapamil was significantly associated with cancer with RRs of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.0) and 2.0 (1.01-3.9), respectively, whereas no associations were found with the other CCB in this study, i.e. diltiazem and nifedipine. A significantly increased risk of cancer was found for intermediate daily doses of verapamil and diltiazem. Intake of other antihypertensives such as beta-blocking agents, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors was not associated with cancer. In the third analysis with exposure to CCB as time-varying co-variates, the risk increase was non-significant for use of 2 years or less, 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7-1.5), and for use for a cumulative period of more than 2 years, 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.0). However, in all models the hazard ratio was statistically significantly increased for verapamil, but not for diltiazem and nifedipine. On the basis of these analyses, we found no increase in cancer in users of diltiazem and nifedipine, nor in users of other antihypertensives. In line with earlier studies, however, we found an increased risk of cancer in users of verapamil. At variance with the conclusions from several other studies, we think that it is too early to conclude that CCB are not associated with cancer.},

Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease).\\ Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31).\\ Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.},

   Abstract={The immunomodulating effects of both immunosuppressive and nifedipine medication have been associated with drug-induced gingival overgrowth. The aim of the study reported here was to evaluate the presence of macrophage subpopulations in normal human gingiva and in gingival overgrowth induced by nifedipine and immunosuppressive medication.\\ Gingival samples were taken from 11 nifedipine-medicated cardiac outpatients (nifedipine group), 11 triple-medicated organ-transplant recipients also taking nifedipine (immunosuppression plus nifedipine group), 12 triple-medicated organ-transplant recipients (immunosuppression group), and 20 generally healthy individuals (control group). Cryostat sections were stained with mAbs for inflammatory 27E10, reparative RM3/1, and resident 25F9 macrophages using an avidin-biotin enzyme complex method. Total numbers of mAb-labeled cells were determined in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium, connective tissue beneath oral epithelium, and middle connective tissue. Expression of 27E10 was determined in keratinocytes in the oral epithelium. Statistics analyses were undertaken using the chi-square test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the independent samples t test, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance.\\ Greater numbers of inflammatory 27E10-positive macrophages were found in all 3 medicated groups and counting zones than in the control group except in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium in the immunosuppression group. The incidence of specimens expressing 27E10 antigen throughout the oral epithelium was significantly higher in the immunosuppression group (8 of 12) than in the control group (4 of 20) and the nifedipine group (2 of 11). Numbers of reparative RM3/1-positive macrophages were significantly greater in the immunosuppression group in connective tissue beneath oral epithelium than in the control group. The effect was markedly associated with degree of inflammation. Numbers of resident 25F9-positive macrophages were lower in connective tissue beneath sulcular epithelium in the immunosuppression group, and higher in middle connective tissue in the nifedipine group than in the control group.\\ Our results show that the nature of drug-induced gingival overgrowth differs somewhat between immunosuppressive and nifedipine medications.},

   Abstract={Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies are common clinical occurrences in hypertensive patients. Treatment practices vary considerably to because of the lack of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic agent over another. This paper was designed to review the evidence for various pharmacotherapeutic regimens in the management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, in terms of the agents' abilities to reach predetermined "safe" goal blood pressures (BPs), and to prevent adverse events.\\ medline was searched from 1966 to 2001, and the reference lists of all the articles were retrieved and searched for relevant references, and experts in the field were contacted to identify other relevant studies. The Cochrane Library was also searched. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review were systematic reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) and individual RCTs, all-or-none studies, systematic reviews of cohort studies and individual cohort studies, and outcomes research. No language restrictions were used.\\ None of the trials included in this review identified an optimal rate of BP lowering in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The definitions of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies were not consistent, but emergencies always involved target end-organ damage, and urgencies were without such damage. Measures of outcome were not uniform between studies. The 4 hypertensive emergency and 15 hypertensive urgency studies represented 236 and 1,074 patients, respectively. The evidence indicated a nonsignificant trend toward increased efficacy with urapidil compared to nitroprusside for hypertensive emergencies (number needed to treat [NNT] for urapidil to achieve target BP, 12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], number of patients needed to harm [NNH], 5 to NNT, 40 compared to nitroprusside). Several medications were efficacious in treating hypertensive urgencies, including: nicardipine (NNT for nicardipine compared to plabebo, 2 in one study [95% CI, 1 to 5] and 1 in another [95% CI, 1 to 1]); lacidipine (NNT, 2; 95% CI, 1 to 8 for lacidipine vs nifedipine) or urapidil (NNT for urapidil compared to enalaprilat and nifedipine, 4; 95% CI, 3 to 6); and nitroprusside and fenoldopam (all patients reached target BP in 2 studies). The studies reported 2 cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to nifedipine.\\ Many effective agents exist for the treatment of hypertensive crises. Because of the lack of large randomized controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered, such as follow-up times and whether any of the studied agents have mortality benefit.},

   Abstract={Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.\\ We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation after a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.\\ After a mean (+/-SD) of 2.3+/-0.6 years, 39 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary end point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end point was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The distribution of the various components of the primary end point was similar in the rate-control and rhythm-control groups.\\ Rate control is not inferior to rhythm control for the prevention of death and morbidity from cardiovascular causes and may be appropriate therapy in patients with a recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion.},

   Abstract={Hypertension is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, with no known treatment to prevent progressive declines leading to ESRD.\\ To compare the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure (BP) control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in hypertension.\\ Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial with enrollment from February 1995 to September 1998.\\ A total of 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (GFR, 20-65 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) were recruited from 21 clinical centers throughout the United States and followed up for 3 to 6.4 years.\\ Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, 102 to 107 mm Hg (usual; n = 554) or 92 mm Hg or less (lower; n = 540), and to initial treatment with either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50-200 mg/d; n = 441), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 2.5-10 mg/d; n = 436) or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (amlodipine 5-10 mg/d; n = 217). Open-label agents were added to achieve the assigned BP goals.\\ Rate of change in GFR (GFR slope); clinical composite outcome of reduction in GFR by 50% or more (or > or =25 mL/min per 1.73 m2) from baseline, ESRD, or death. Three primary treatment comparisons were specified: lower vs usual BP goal; ramipril vs metoprolol; and amlodipine vs metoprolol.\\ Achieved BP averaged (SD) 128/78 (12/8) mm Hg in the lower BP group and 141/85 (12/7) mm Hg in the usual BP group. The mean (SE) GFR slope from baseline through 4 years did not differ significantly between the lower BP group (-2.21 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year) and the usual BP group (-1.95 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year; P =.24), and the lower BP goal did not significantly reduce the rate of the clinical composite outcome (risk reduction for lower BP group = 2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -22% to 21%; P =.85). None of the drug group comparisons showed consistent significant differences in the GFR slope. However, compared with the metoprolol and amlodipine groups, the ramipril group manifested risk reductions in the clinical composite outcome of 22% (95% CI, 1%-38%; P =.04) and 38% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P =.004), respectively. There was no significant difference in the clinical composite outcome between the amlodipine and metoprolol groups.\\ No additional benefit of slowing progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis was observed with the lower BP goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be more effective than beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in slowing GFR decline.},

   Abstract={The OROS osmotic (OSM) dosage form optimises extended-release oral administration by controlling the rate of drug release for a predetermined time, providing constant, patterned, or pulsed delivery profiles. OSM products include prescription medications for urology, CNS, and cardiovascular indications, as well as over-the-counter nasal/sinus congestion medications.\\ This retrospective study examines US gastrointestinal (GI) safety data for the OROS dosage form following nearly two decades of use. Although GI injury and obstruction are known effects of oral medications, some reports have suggested that extended-release products pose a greater risk of GI injury and obstruction than other oral dosage forms. Products incorporating OROS technology are being prescribed to an expanding range of patients; a review of the GI safety data for this dosage form thus seemed timely and appropriate. US safety information was obtained from three sources: English language literature published from 1982 until June 1, 2000 from five major biomedical databases;postmarketing safety reports from January 1, 1983 until June 1, 2000 available through the Freedom of Information Act; andcommercial safety information obtained directly from ALZA Corporation's in-house safety database for those OSM products for which ALZA has reporting responsibility. US distribution data from IMS National Prescription Audit trade mark Plus data were used to estimate cumulative product distribution totals. These totals were combined with numbers of unique GI events to determine the estimated frequency of events.\\ Nearly 13 billion OSM tablets are estimated to have been distributed in the US. The incidence of all clinically significant GI adverse events for OSM products (including intestinal, gastric, and oesophageal irritation, injury, and obstruction) reported in the US was approximately one case in >76 million tablets distributed. The majority (78%; estimated incidence: one case in 29 million tablets) of cases were reported in patients taking Procardia XL (nifedipine). Oesophageal and lower GI obstruction were reported primarily in patients with pre-existing abnormalities or disease of the GI tract. Among paediatric patients, one obstruction was reported in an estimated 37.7 million tablets distributed. Reports of GI irritation associated with OSM products were consistent with known effects of the same drug substances in other dosage forms.\\ A review of long-term safety experience with products using OSM controlled-release technology yields a low incidence of clinically significant GI events. Properly prescribed, extended-release products provide substantial therapeutic and convenience benefits without additional risk.},

   Abstract={The present study was conducted among 719 patients enrolled by 109 doctors to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of losartan potassium and amlodipine besylate in Indian patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Out of them 11 patients were dropped out. Of these 708 patients 643 patients received once daily dosage of the combination whereas 10 patients received 1/2 daily, 13 patients received 1 1/2 daily and 42 patients received 1 twice daily dosage of the combination. The mean SBP in the study was 172.89 +/- 19.18 mm Hg baseline. After the 10-day treatment, the mean SBP had significant reduction ie, 13.1% from basal and at the end of day 20 of the treatment, the reduction was 19.13% from the baseline which was significant. Similarly mean DBP was 105.42 +/- 10.85 mm Hg at baseline. After treatment, the mean DBP had significant reduction. After 10- day treatment, there was 12.7% reduction from the baseline and at the end of the treatment ie, after day 20, the reduction was 17.70% from basal, which was significant. Global evaluation of efficacy was done by the physicians; 93.8% of the cases had excellent to good response and 4.9% patients had fair response. Details of any adverse event reported or noted during the treatment with the combination were recorded in the appropriate section of the case record form, whether considered treatment related or not, as reported by the patients. The severity of an adverse event was graded on a 3-point scale as mild, moderate and severe. The most common side-effects reported were oedema of feet (5.08%), ankle oedema (1.98%). Remaining adverse events included some cardiovascular events such as palpitations, gastro-intestinal events such as constipation, miscellaneous events, muscular pain, weakness, generalised swelling, etc. CNS events included giddiness, headache, insomnia, etc.},

Amlodipine is an effective antianginal agent, whereas ARBs are not. However, amlodipine is not effective in the treatment of heart failure; ARBs may be useful in this setting. ARBs are also effective in preserving renal function and may provide some protection from restenosis in patients who have had a PCI. The ARBs may also be useful in preventing both diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy.\\ Concomitant disease states should be considered when choosing between an ARB and amlodipine for the management of hypertension.},

   Abstract={After the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial ended in February 1997, randomized patients were offered active study medication for a further period of observation.\\ To refine the estimates of the long-term effects of antihypertensive therapy on the incidence of dementia.\\ Eligible patients had no dementia and were at least 60 years old. Their systolic blood pressure at entry was 160 to 219 mm Hg, with diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg. Antihypertensive therapy was started immediately after randomization in the active treatment group, but only after termination of the double-blind trial in the control patients. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/d), with the possible addition of enalapril maleate (5-20 mg/d), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/d), or both add-on drugs.\\ Median follow-up increased from 2.0 years in the double-blind trial to 3.9 years overall. The incidence of dementia doubled from 32 to 64 cases, 41 of whom had Alzheimer disease. Throughout follow-up, systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 7.0/3.2 mm Hg higher in the 1417 control patients than in the 1485 subjects randomized to active treatment. At the last examination, the blood pressure difference was still 4.2/2.9 mm Hg; 48.1%, 26.4%, and 11.4% of the control patients were taking nitrendipine, enalapril, and/or hydrochlorothiazide, whereas in the active treatment group these proportions were 70.2%, 35.4%, and 18.4%, respectively. Compared with the controls, long-term antihypertensive therapy reduced the risk of dementia by 55%, from 7.4 to 3.3 cases per 1000 patient-years (43 vs 21 cases, P<.001). After adjustment for sex, age, education, and entry blood pressure, the relative hazard rate associated with the use of nitrendipine was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.64; P<.001). Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years can prevent 20 cases of dementia (95% confidence interval, 7-33).\\ The extended follow-up of Syst-Eur patients reinforces the evidence that blood pressure-lowering therapy initiated with a long-acting dihydropyridine protects against dementia in older patients with systolic hypertension.},

   Abstract={Several reports suggest that markers of renal function such as serum creatinine, serum uric acid, and urinary excretion of protein may be related to cardiovascular complications and mortality. This study analyzed the data from the Syst-Eur trial, which was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention trial in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The purpose was to evaluate whether serum levels of creatinine and uric acid and urinary protein excretion at entry are related to subsequent morbidity and mortality. Incidence rates of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke (fatal as well as nonfatal), coronary events, and all cardiovascular endpoints were calculated for each quintile of serum creatinine or serum uric acid or for each category of protein excretion (none, trace, and overt). Crude and adjusted relative hazard rates were also determined for each 20 micro M increase in serum creatinine, each 50 micro M increase in serum uric acid, and for each protein excretion category. Even when adjusted for age, gender, and various other covariates, serum creatinine was significantly associated with a worse prognosis. There was an U-shaped relationship between serum uric acid and total mortality, but otherwise no obvious relationships were detected between serum uric acid levels and complications when appropriate adjustments were made for confounding variables. Proteinuria at entry was a significant predictor of total mortality and all cardiovascular endpoints. It is concluded that higher levels of serum creatinine and trace or overt proteinuria are associated with an increased number of cardiovascular events and with a higher mortality in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.},

   Abstract={Elevated urine albumin excretion (UAER) is a modifiable risk factor for renal and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system lowers UAER, but whether this effect is independent of blood pressure (BP) reduction remains controversial. The MicroAlbuminuria Reduction With VALsartan (MARVAL) study was designed to evaluate the BP-independent effect of valsartan on UAER in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.\\ Three hundred thirty-two patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, with or without hypertension, were randomly assigned to 80 mg/d valsartan or 5 mg/d amlodipine for 24 weeks. A target BP of 135/85 mm Hg was aimed for by dose-doubling followed by addition of bendrofluazide and doxazosin whenever needed. The primary end point was the percent change in UAER from baseline to 24 weeks. The UAER at 24 weeks was 56% (95% CI, 49.6 to 63.0) of baseline with valsartan and 92% (95% CI, 81.7 to 103.7) of baseline with amlodipine, a highly significant between-group effect (P<0.001). Valsartan lowered UAER similarly in both the hypertensive and normotensive subgroups. More patients reversed to normoalbuminuria with valsartan (29.9% versus 14.5%; P=0.001). Over the study period, BP reductions were similar between the two treatments (systolic/diastolic 11.2/6.6 mm Hg for valsartan, 11.6/6.5 mm Hg for amlodipine) and at no time point was there a between-group significant difference in BP values in either the hypertensive or the normotensive subgroup.\\ For the same level of attained BP and the same degree of BP reduction, valsartan lowered UAER more effectively than amlodipine in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, including the subgroup with baseline normotension. This indicates a BP-independent antiproteinuric effect of valsartan.},

It is not known if T-type calcium-channel blockade is superior to L-type calcium-channel blockade in patients with stable angina pectoris.\\ A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in patients with documented coronary disease and stable angina to compare a 360 mg dose of diltiazem CD with 100 mg dose of mibefradil. The primary end point was change in time to symptom-limited exercise termination from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary efficacy parameters included time to onset of persistent ST-segment depression, time to awareness of angina, and change in exercise duration from baseline to 2 and 4 weeks of treatment.\\ A total of 121 patients were randomized to mibefradil and 113 to diltiazem CD. At 8 weeks, the increase in exercise duration was 24.5 seconds greater in the mibefradil group (P =.017; 95% CI 4.4-44.7 seconds). At 8 weeks, time to development of > or =1 mm ST-segment depression was greater by 45.3 seconds (P =.0025; 95% CI 16.2-74.5) with mibefradil, but time to development of angina was not significantly different.\\ T-type calcium-channel antagonism with mibefradil improved treadmill exercise parameters compared with diltiazem in patients with chronic stable angina. Further investigation and development of antagonists of T-type calcium channels with fewer adverse drug interactions is warranted and may be promising in the management of ischemic heart disease.},

   Abstract={This study sought to investigate the cardiac and renal effects of rigorous versus standard BP control on autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). A prospective, randomized, 7-yr study was performed to examine the effect of rigorous (<120/80 mmHg) versus standard (135-140/85-90 mmHg) BP control on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and kidney function in 75 hypertensive ADPKD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. LVMI was measured by echocardiogram at baseline and at 1 and 7 yr. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and 24-h creatinine clearance every 6 mo for 3 yr, then annually for an additional 4 yr. The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. During the study, average mean arterial pressure was 90 +/- 5 mmHg for the rigorous group and 101 +/- 4 mmHg for the standard group (P < 0.0001). The LVMI decreased by 21% in the standard group and by 35% in the rigorous group. A mixed model longitudinal data analysis revealed that rigorous BP control was significantly more effective in decreasing LVMI (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in renal function between the two groups. In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy, a major cardiovascular risk factor, was decreased to a significantly greater extent by rigorous than standard BP control. This finding has particular clinical importance because cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of death in ADPKD patients.},

   Abstract={The aim of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study was to compare patients with essential hypertension receiving calcium-antagonist-based treatment with diltiazem and similar patients receiving conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based treatment, with respect to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\\ To assess the influence of age, sex, severity of hypertension and heart rate on treatment effects, in a sub-analysis.\\ The NORDIL study was prospective, randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, 10 881 patients aged 50-74 years who had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 100 mmHg or more. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were decreased by 20.3/18.7 mmHg in the diltiazem group and by 23.3/18.7 mmHg in the diuretic/beta-blocker group - a significant difference in SBP (P < 0.001).\\ The incidence of the primary endpoint - a composite of cardiovascular death, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction - was similar for the two treatments. Fatal and non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the diltiazem group and in 196 patients in the conventional treatment group [relative risk (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; P = 0.040], whereas there was a non-significant inverse tendency with respect to all myocardial infarction. There were significantly fewer cerebral strokes in patients receiving diltiazem in the subgroups with baseline SBP > 170 mmHg (n = 5420, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; P = 0.032), DBP >/= 105 mmHg (n = 5881, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.97; P = 0.030) and pulse pressure >/= 66 mmHg (n = 5461, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.99, P = 0.041), and more myocardial infarctions in those with heart rate less than 74 beats/min (n = 5303, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; P = 0.040). However, the tendencies for fewer strokes and greater incidence of myocardial infarction were present across subgroups when results were analysed for age, sex, severity of hypertension and heart rate, and treatment-subgroup interaction analyses were not statistically significant.\\ Compared with a conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based antihypertensive regimen, there were additional 25% reductions in stroke in the diltiazem-treated patients with blood pressure or pulse pressure greater than the medians, and an increase in myocardial infarction in those with heart rate less than the median. Such findings may be attributable to chance, but the consistency of, in particular, the stroke findings may also suggest an ability of diltiazem, beyond conventional treatment, to prevent cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients with the greatest cardiovascular risk.},

   Abstract={There is concern over the safety of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in acute coronary disease. We sought to determine if patients taking calcium channel blockers (CCBs) at the time of admission with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had a higher case-fatality compared with those taking beta-blockers or neither medication. Clinical and drug treatment variables at the time of hospital admission predictive of survival at 28 days were examined in a community-based registry of patients aged under 65 years admitted to hospital for suspected AMI in Perth, Australia, between 1984 and 1993. Among 7766 patients, 1291 (16.6%) were taking a CCB and 1259 (16.2%) a betablocker alone at hospital admission. Patients taking CCBs had a worse clinical profile than those taking a beta-blocker alone or neither drug (control group), and a higher unadjusted 28-day mortality (17.6% versus 9.3% and 11.1% respectively, both P < 0.001). There was no significant heterogeneity with respect to mortality between nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil when used alone, or with a beta-blocker. After adjustment for factors predictive of death at 28 days, patients taking a CCB were found not to have an excess chance of death compared with the control group (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.87, 1.30), whereas those taking a beta-blocker alone had a lower odds of death (OR 0.75, 95% CI; 0.59, 0.94). These results indicate that established calcium channel blockade is not associated with an excess risk of death following AMI once other differences between patients are taken into account, but neither does it have the survival advantage seen with prior beta-blocker therapy.},

Scales contributing to physical health and a summary measure, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (mean, 43.4 +/- 10.9 [SD]), were significantly lower than scales relating to mental health and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score (51.3 +/- 10.3). All scales (except Role-Physical) and the PCS and MCS were significantly higher in men (44.3 +/- 10.9 and 51.8 +/- 10.0, respectively) than women (41.9 +/- 10.8 and 50.5 +/- 10.6, respectively). In multivariate analysis, employment status, education level, household income, body mass index, comorbid medical conditions, years of hypertension, number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed, exercise status, and male sex were significant independent predictors of PCS. Fewer factors predicted MCS and included employment status, marital status, current smoking, age, comorbid medical conditions, and male sex. In the entire AASK cohort, mean scores for individual scales, except Mental Health, and the PCS were lower, but the mean MCS score was slightly higher than values for the US general population. Values for individual scales of the SF-36 and the PCS were substantially higher among AASK participants compared with African-American hemodialysis patients. Six of the eight scales were lower in the AASK cohort compared with groups of racially mixed and exclusively African-American hypertensive subjects. We conclude that physical aspects of quality of life are substantially reduced compared with mental components among AASK participants, and a number of demographic and clinical characteristics significantly impact on HRQL.},

However, since office blood pressure measurements reflect to a limited extent blood pressure outside the office, a side-arm INSIGHT study in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also performed.\\ The study had a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design. After 4 weeks of placebo, mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients were randomized to nifedipine GITS 30 mg or amiloride 2.5 + hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg for 3.1 years. Dose titration was performed by dose doubling and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg, or other drugs when needed. Analysis was carried out by intention-to-treat and included computation of 24 h, day and night ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate values. Additional analyses included computation of the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index (the ratio between the average of the 24-hourly blood pressure reductions after treatment and its standard deviation).\\ A total of 151 patients were recruited and 149 were valid for analysis: 78 patients had 24 h ambulatory recordings both at baseline and during treatment and 134 during treatment. Office, 24 h and day and night blood pressures were all significantly and similarly reduced by both treatments. Office and ambulatory heart rate was left unchanged by diuretics, while it was slightly reduced by nifedipine. Median trough-to-peak ratios were always > 0.5 and superimposable between the two treatment groups. Similarly, smoothness indices of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were comparably high for nifedipine and diuretics, thus demonstrating a similar well-balanced antihypertensive response to both drugs. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in the number of cardiovascular events (17 in the nifedipine-based and 26 in the diuretics-based treatment group).\\ In the INSIGHT study, the long-term antihypertensive effect on 24 h blood pressure and the cardiovascular protection of nifedipine was similar to that of diuretics.},

   Abstract={Fifteen elderly patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function and New York Heart Association functional class II-III were studied. The effect of verapamil on LV diastolic function was assessed by congestive heart failure (CHF) score, treadmill exercise test, and Doppler echocardiography at baseline, and after each three-month treatment period (placebo or verapamil 120 mg once daily), separated by a one-week washout period before crossover. Blood pressure, heart rate, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and cardiac output were unaltered by placebo or verapamil. Verapamil treatment significantly improved CHF score at 3 months (3.5 +/- 0.5, p<0.05) compared with baseline (5.6 +/- 0.5) or placebo (5.5 +/- 0.5). The exercise time was similar at baseline (7.4 +/- 1.2 min) and after placebo (7.4 +/- 1.3 min) treatment but significantly (p<0.05) increased after verapamil (8.3 +/- 1.2 min) treatment. The ratio of mitral A wave duration/pulmonary venous atrial systolic reversal duration increased after verapamil (1.11 +/- 0.08) treatment compared with placebo (0.91 +/- 0.07, p<0.05) and baseline (0.89 +/- 0.08) which had similar durations. The isovolumic relaxation time was significantly (p<0.05) decreased from 84 +/- 12 ms at baseline and 86 +/- 13 ms with placebo to 73 +/- 9 ms with verapamil. The results of this study suggest that in elderly patients with Doppler evidence of diastolic dysfunction as the cause of CHF, three months treatment with verapamil can improve CHF, increase exercise tolerance and improve LV diastolic function.},

In addition, the reasons for stopping the first-line treatment (nitrendipine), the second-line treatments (enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide) and the corresponding placebos, were determined.\\ A total of 135 patients (6%) were withdrawn by the investigators from placebo treatment because their blood pressure was too high, and, similarly, 36 (1.6%) through patient initiation. The corresponding results for the actively treated patients were 14 (0.6%) and 7 (0.3%). Very few patients were withdrawn from the trial because of the adverse effects of treatment. However, 39 (4%) stopped taking active nitrendipine because of ankle oedema, compared with 4 (0.5%) on placebo. Similarly, 28 versus three stopped due to flushing. Forty-one (10%) stopped taking enalapril because of cough, against eight (2%) for enalapril placebo. In all, 15.0% stopped active nitrendipine, 20.2% enalapril and 6.3% hydrochlorothiazide, versus placebo 7.1, 9.1 and 5.1%.\\ The numbers withdrawn from the trial for adverse treatment consequences were small in comparison to the cardiovascular benefits. Nevertheless the numbers stopping individual treatments were higher than expected.},

   Abstract={OBJECTIVES; We present a meta-analysis based on three recent, substantial, randomized outcome trials and several smaller trials that compared calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with conventional therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers) or with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\\ There is continuing uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of CCBs in the treatment of hypertension. Previous meta-analyses conflict and suggest that CCBs increase myocardial infarction (MI) or protect from stroke.\\ Standard procedures for meta-analysis were used to analyze three major trials on 21,611 patients and another three lesser studies to a total of 24,322 patients.\\ Calcium channel blockers have a strikingly similar risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and of major cardiovascular events to conventional therapy. Calcium channel blockers give a lower risk of nonfatal stroke (-25%, p = 0.001) and a higher risk of total MI (18%, p = 0.013), chiefly nonfatal (18%). After performing the Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, these p values become 0.004 and 0.052, respectively. When compared with ACE inhibitors in 1,318 diabetic patients, CCBs had a substantially higher risk of nonfatal (relative risk [RR] = 2.259) and total MI (RR = 2.204, confidence interval 1.501 to 3.238; p = 0.001 or 0.004 with Bonferroni correction). Total and cardiovascular mortality rates are similar. To confirm the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are superior to CCBs in diabetic patients requires more trial data, especially with renal end points.\\ Mortality (total and cardiovascular) and major cardiovascular events with CCBs were apparently similar to those events seen with conventional first-line therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers). Stroke reduction more than balanced increased MI. In diabetics, CCBs may be less safe than ACE inhibitors.},

   Abstract={To review the epidemiology, mechanisms, complications, predictors, prevention, and treatment of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery.\\ MEDLINE search of English-language reports published between 1966 and 2000 and a search of references of relevant papers.\\ Clinical and basic research studies on atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.\\ Relevant clinical information was extracted from selected articles.\\ Atrial fibrillation occurs in 10% to 65% of patients after cardiac surgery, usually on the second or third postoperative day. Postoperative atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and longer, more expensive hospital stays. Prophylactic use of beta-adrenergic blockers reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and should be administered before and after cardiac surgery to all patients without contraindication. Prophylactic amiodarone and atrial overdrive pacing should be considered in patients at high risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation (for example, patients with previous atrial fibrillation or mitral valve surgery). For patients who develop atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, a strategy of rhythm management or rate management should be selected. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable or highly symptomatic or who have a contraindication to anticoagulation, rhythm management with electrical cardioversion, amiodarone, or both is preferred. Treatment of the remaining patients should focus on rate control because most will spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks after discharge. All patients with atrial fibrillation persisting for more than 24 to 48 hours and without contraindication should receive anticoagulation.\\ Atrial fibrillation frequently complicates cardiac surgery. Many cases can be prevented with appropriate prophylactic therapy. A strategy of rhythm management for symptomatic patients and rate management for all other patients usually results in reversion to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks of discharge.},

   Abstract={Treatment of posttransplant hypertension is still a matter of debate. Calcium antagonists may ameliorate renal side effects of cyclosporin. Angiotensin converting enzyme- (ACE) inhibitors may be more effective in sustaining renal function in native chronic renal disease. We prospectively compared the effect of controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril on long-term renal function in hypertensive kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporin.\\ A total of 154 renal transplant patients presenting with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure >or=95 mmHg) during the first 3 weeks after transplantation were randomised to receive double-blind nifedipine 30 mg or lisinopril 10 mg once daily. A total of 123 patients completed 1 year of treatment (69 nifedipine, 54 lisinopril) and 64 patients completed 2 years of double-blind treatment (39 nifedipine, 25 lisinopril). Baseline glomerular filtration rate was measured as 99 mTc-diethylene-triaminepentaacetate clearance in a stable phase 2 to 5 weeks after inclusion and repeated at 1 and 2 years.\\ Baseline glomerular filtration rates were similar (46+/-16 ml/min with nifedipine, 43+/-14 ml/min with lisinopril). The changes in glomerular filtration rates from baseline were statistically significant between the groups after 1 year (9.6 ml/min mean treatment difference (95% confidence interval [CI]s 5.5-13.7 ml/min, P=0.0001) and remained statistically significant also after 2 years (10.3 ml/min mean difference (95% CIs 4.0-16.6], P=0.0017). After 1 year glomerular filtration rates averaged 56+/-19 ml/min in the nifedipine group and 44+/-14 ml/min in the lisinopril group.\\ Both nifedipine and lisinopril were safe and effective in treatment of hypertension in renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporin. Patients receiving nifedipine but not lisinopril improved kidney transplant function over a period of 2 years.},

Safety was assessed by adverse event frequency, measurement of vital signs and laboratory parameters, and quality of life. At the final visit, the total exercise time was significantly greater relative to baseline with amlodipine than isosorbide mononitrate (final/baseline difference: 112.2 vs. 32.2, p = 0.016).

   Abstract={Our purpose was to study the safety of controlled-onset, extended-release (COER) verapamil in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease, with a focus on elderly patients.\\ Adverse event data were pooled from 7 double-blind, multicenter, randomized trials including 1999 patients with hypertension or chronic stable angina pectoris. There were 1042 patients who received COER verapamil 180 to 540 mg once daily in the evening for up to 10 weeks, 373 patients who received placebo, and 584 who received an active comparator agent. Data were analyzed according to the following groups: all patients, patients with hypertension, patients with angina, older patients (>/=65 years old), and younger patients (<65 years old). Adverse event rates were compared across the treatment groups by the Fisher exact test.\\ In all patients combined, the incidence of constipation (13% vs 2%), dizziness (6% vs 2%), and back pain (3% vs 1%) was higher in patients treated with COER verapamil than with placebo. Patients with hypertension had more back pain (4% vs 1%) and constipation (12% vs 1%) with COER verapamil than with placebo, whereas patients with angina had more bradycardia (2.6% vs 0%), dizziness (8% vs 2%), and constipation (15% vs 3%). Older patients treated with COER verapamil had more bradycardia, constipation, dizziness, and fatigue and had fewer headaches compared with younger patients treated with COER verapamil. Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block was not observed after administration of COER verapamil in any subgroup.\\ These data demonstrate that COER verapamil has an acceptable safety profile that is largely unrelated to age in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease.},

   Abstract={Asubstantial number of older hypertensive patients have stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure between 140 and 159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), but there are currently no data showing that drug treatment is effective, safe, and/or beneficial. To compare the effects of active treatment compared with placebo on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and quality of life among older stage 1 isolated systolic hypertensive patients, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial comparing felodipine (2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily) and matching placebo was performed in 171 patients (49% male, average age 66+/-7 years, with 49% white and 30% Hispanic) with a baseline blood pressure of 149+/-7/83+/-6 mm Hg. During 52 weeks of treatment, patients randomized to active treatment achieved significantly lower blood pressures (137.0+/-11.7/80.2+/-7.6 mm Hg for extended-release felodipine versus 147.5+/-16.0/83.5+/-9.7 mm Hg for placebo, P<0.01 for each), a reduced incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (7% for extended release felodipine versus 24% for placebo, P<0.04), and improved quality of life (change in Psychological General Well-Being index, 3.0+/-6.8 for extended-release felodipine versus -0.8+/-10.3 for placebo, P<0.01) versus baseline. There were no clinically significant differences between treatments in tolerability or adverse effects. Stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension can be effectively and safely treated pharmacologically. Treatment reduced progression to the higher stages of hypertension, reduced the incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved an overall measure of the quality of life. Larger and longer studies will be needed to document any long-term reduction in cardiovascular event rates associated with treating stage 1 systolic hypertension.},

After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomized to either NI 30 mg or AM 5 mg. Responders continued on the same dosage for 16 additional weeks, while non-responders were titrated to 60 mg NI or 10 mg AM.\\ Blood pressure was measured by mercury sphygmomanometer and efficacy equivalence of NI and AM tested by covariance analysis. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the primary efficacy parameter, its baseline value being taken as covariate while centers effect and treatment interaction were included as fixed effects in the analysis model. The secondary efficacy variables systolic blood pressure (SBP) and scores for QOL were analyzed according to the same model.\\ At the end of the study, overall mean DBPs, calculated as least-square means (LSMEANS), in the "by protocol" population were 87.5 mmHg for NI and 86.7 for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg with 90% CI -1.2 to 2.8 mmHg). In the "by intention to treat" (ITT) population LSMEANS were 87.6 mmHg for NI and 86.4 mmHg for AM (difference 1.2 mmHg with 90% CI -0.6 to 3.1 mmHg). SBP LSMEANS in the "by protocol" population were 147.7 mmHg for NI and 147.3 mmHg for AM (difference 0.3 mmHg, with 90% CI -3.7 to 4.3); corresponding values in the "by ITT" population were 148.0 mmHg for NI and 147.2 for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg, with 90% CI -2.8 to 4.6). Mean values for QOL parameters were not significantly different. A total of 173 episodes of adverse events were documented in 54 patients (26 NI and 28 AM), dropouts were 15 (20% of group) on NI and 21 (28%) on AM.\\ NI 30-60 mg was shown to be as efficacious and safe as AM 5-10 mg in elderly patients with mild-moderate hypertension. QOL improved compared to baseline with no significant difference between the two drugs, thus confirming a positive class effect for calcium antagonists.},

   Abstract={To investigate in a random comparison the capacity of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (fosinopril), and that of a long-acting dihydropiridine (nifedipine GITS) to modify the decay in renal function in patients with primary renal disease, exhibiting a progressive increase in serum creatinine during the previous 2 years.\\ A randomized, open-label, multicenter study with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. A total of 241 patients were included in the study. All of them were hypertensive and had a 25% or at least 0.5 mg/dl increase in the value of serum creatinine during the 24 months prior to entering the study. Initial doses of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS were 10 and 30 mg respectively, and titration to 30 and 60 mg was performed if needed to obtain the expected blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mmHg). Furosemide, atenolol, and doxazosin were added as second, third, and fourth drugs if necessary, for blood pressure control. The primary end-point of the study was the appearance of double the serum creatinine values and/or the need to enter a dialysis programme. Secondary end-points were cardiovascular events, death, changes in 24 h proteinuria, and the evolution of serum creatinine. Data reflect the analysis performed by intention to treat.\\ Mean age of the group was 54 +/- 14, and 59% were males. Primary glomerulonephritis (31%), nephrosclerosis (26%) and polycystic kidney disease (19%) were the three most frequent diagnostic findings. After 3 years of follow-up, 21% (27/127) of patients treated with fosinopril, and 36% (40/112) of those receiving nifedipine GITS presented a primary end-point, (OR 0.47, 95% confidence intervals 0.26-0.84, P = 0.01). Renal survival was significantly better when fosinopril constituted the first step therapy (P = 0.002). These results did not seem to be influenced by the type of primary renal disease. Proteinuria decreased at the end of the study by a mean of 57% in the fosinopril group and increased by 7% in the group receiving dihydropiridine. Blood pressure control did not differ among groups for diastolic values. During follow-up, however, the patients receiving ACEi showed systolic blood pressure values 4-6 mmHg lower.\\ In patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension due to primary renal disease, fosinopril significantly differed from nifedipine GITS by its capacity to slow the progressive decay in renal function. The drugs also differed by their capacity to lower blood pressure. The better control, in particular of systolic blood pressure, in the fosinopril arm could have contributed in a relevant manner to the attainment of a better outcome when the ACEi was employed.},

   Abstract={The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study showed that when antihypertensive treatment reduces diastolic blood pressure well below 90 mmHg, there can be a further reduction of cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, with no evidence of a J-shaped curve at lower pressures. Office measurement, however, gives no information about blood pressure outside the office. This paper describes a HOT substudy in which patients underwent both office measurement and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.\\ The mean age of the substudy population was 62 +/- 7 years. Substudy patients were treated for a median period of 2 years. All received the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, while some also received an ACE-inhibitor, a beta-blocker or a diuretic. Average 24 h, day and night ambulatory blood pressure values were computed at baseline (n = 277) and during treatment (n = 347): 112 patients had been randomized to a target office diastolic blood pressure  or = 60 years, with systolic blood pressure 160-219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 95 mm Hg) were randomised to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine, with the possible addition of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, or both, titrated or combined to reduce the sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Patients never taking NSAIDs (n = 2882) were compared with patients on chronic NSAID intake (n = 861), defined as reporting NSAID intake on at least 50% of the patient forms.\\ There was a tendency towards lower mortality (relative hazard rate (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77 (0.56-1.06)) and higher incidence of bleeding (1.13 (0.63-2.05) with chronic NSAID intake. Although there was no significant interaction between calcium-channel blocker (CCB)-based treatment and chronic NSAID intake for any of the end points, chronic NSAID intake tended to be associated with a lower incidence of bleeding on active treatment as compared to placebo (P-value of the interaction term = 0.07).\\ The effect of chronic NSAID intake on outcome was similar in patients on active treatment based on a dihydropyridine CCB or on placebo. However, chronic NSAID intake might have a less deleterious effect on bleeding on active treatment as compared to placebo.},

   Abstract={Many relapses of atrial fibrillation (AF) occur, especially during the first week(s) after electrical cardioversion (ECV). The aim of the present study was to compare in a randomized design the efficacy of verapamil (intracellular calcium lowering) versus digoxin (calcium increasing) for maintenance of sinus rhythm after ECV.\\ Ninety-seven patients with persistent AF were randomized to verapamil (n = 49) or digoxin (n = 48) for 1 month before and 1 month after ECV. The first month after ECV, patients recorded heart rhythm using daily transtelephonic monitoring. No additional antiarrhythmic drugs were given. Of the 97 patients, 43 patients (20 verapamil) underwent ECV per protocol. Median previous AF duration was 18 and 26 days for verapamil and digoxin, respectively. There were no differences in atrial dimensions and underlying heart disease between the two groups. The success rate of ECV was 75% versus 83% (P = NS). After 1 month, 47% versus 53% (P = NS) had recurrence of AF. Median time to recurrence was 5 days (range 0 to 26) versus 8 days (range 2 to 28) (P = NS), respectively.\\ Stand-alone intracellular calcium lowering by verapamil around ECV does not enhance cardioversion outcome.},

   Abstract={Valsartan is an orally active, selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1) receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) Trial of Cardiovascular Events in Hypertension is a double-blind, randomized prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of valsartan with those of the calcium-antagonist amlodipine on the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged 50 years and older, and at particularly high risk of coronary events were enrolled. 18,119 patients were screened and 15,314 patients in 31 countries were randomized mainly between January 1998 and December 1999. These hypertensives had a mean blood pressure of 154.7/87.5 mmHg at the time of their randomization to blinded medication. The population comprises both genders (men 57.6%), Caucasians (89.1%), mean age 67.2 years, mean body mass index 28.6 kg/m2, coronary heart disease (45.8%), high cholesterol (33.0%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (31.7%) and smokers (24.0%). More than 92% of the randomized participants had been treated for high blood pressure for at least 6 months when screened for the study. The randomized population is now being treated (goal blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) in adherence with the protocol until at least 1450 patients experience primary cardiac endpoint defined as clinically evident or aborted myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or death caused by coronary heart disease.},

   Abstract={The role of verapamil in the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with recurrent AF is unknown.\\ The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of verapamil on the prevention of AF in patients implanted with an implantable atrial defibrillator (IAD).\\ The effects of verapamil (240 mg/day) on the total duration of AF, number of AF recurrences, and number of cardioversions were prospectively evaluated in a randomized, crossover fashion over an 8-week period in 11 patients (9 men, 2 women; mean age: 60 +/- 6 years) implanted with an IAD.\\ Implantable atrial defibrillators successfully converted 13 of 14 (93%) spontaneous episodes of AF. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of cardioversion (86 vs. 100%, p = 0.8), the total duration of AF (173 +/- 198 vs. 270 +/- 241 h, p = 0.5), the number of AF episodes (8.5 +/- 9.0 vs. 9.3 +/- 10.2, p = 0.3), and the number of cardioversions (1.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 p = 0.7) with or without treatment with verapamil.\\ The results of the present study suggest that treatment with verapamil has no significant effect on the prevention of AF in patients treated with an LAD.},

This report compares the ramipril and amlodipine groups following discontinuation of the amlodipine intervention in September 2000.\\ Participants were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d (n = 217), ramipril, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 436), or metoprolol, 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 441), with other agents added to achieve 1 of 2 blood pressure goals.\\ The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in GFR; the main secondary outcome was a composite index of the clinical end points of reduction in GFR of more than 50% or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), end-stage renal disease, or death.\\ Among participants with a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of >0.22 (corresponding approximately to proteinuria of more than 300 mg/d), the ramipril group had a 36% (2.02 [SE, 0.74] mL/min per 1.73 m(2)/y) slower mean decline in GFR over 3 years (P =.006) and a 48% reduced risk of the clinical end points vs the amlodipine group (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-66%). In the entire cohort, there was no significant difference in mean GFR decline from baseline to 3 years between treatment groups (P =.38). However, compared with the amlodipine group, after adjustment for baseline covariates the ramipril group had a 38% reduced risk of clinical end points (95% CI, 13%-56%), a 36% slower mean decline in GFR after 3 months (P =.002), and less proteinuria (P<.001).\\ Ramipril, compared with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without proteinuria.},

   Abstract={Treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure has been shown to postpone the decline in renal function. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor has been shown to be superior to conventional antihypertensive treatment, but it is not known how an ACE inhibitor compares to treatment with a calcium channel blocker or to treatment with a combination of these drugs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of decline in GFR in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension treated with isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in combination.\\ Sixty patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension were enrolled in the study. After enrollment, patients were followed prospectively for 6 months in the outpatient clinic on their usual antihypertensive medication, and then randomized to a double-blinded comparison of either spirapril 6 mg daily, isradipine 5 mg daily or spirapril 3 mg and isradipine 2.5 mg daily. After randomization, patients were followed for 21 months or until the need for dialysis. Every 3 months before and 3.5 months after randomization the glomerular filtration rate was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance and the effective renal plasma flow evaluated using the renal clearance of paraaminohippuric acid.\\ Blood pressure and the decline in glomerular filtration rate did not differ between the groups before randomization. After randomization, the mean decline in the glomerular filtration rate was -0.32 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the spirapril group, -0.58 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the isradipine group and -0.14 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the combination group (p = 0.38). Twelve patients, 4 in each group, reached end-stage renal failure. No significant difference was found with respect to diastolic (p = 0.10) or systolic blood pressure (p = 0.08) during the treatment period, but a trend towards a better blood pressure control in the combination group was present. During treatment, the rate of decline in renal plasma flow did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.09), neither did the changes in filtration fraction (FF) (p = 0.58) nor the mean FF (p = 0.22) during the treatment.\\ Our study indicated differences between the 3 treatment modalities in favor of combined therapy with respect to both the rate of decline in GFR and blood pressure control, but the differences where insignificant. Thus, the treatments might differ, but we were unable to confirm this because of large variation in GFR and small sample size.},

   Abstract={This double-blind study compared the efficacy and safety of once daily amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) vs twice daily nifedipine (40-80 mg/day) in 244 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Efficacy was assessed after 4 and 24 weeks by bicycle exercise test.\\ No statistically significant differences were found between the two treatment groups at the end of treatment with regard to the ergometry parameters determined (maximum ST segment deviation, maximum workload in watts, maximum exercise duration and time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression). Furthermore, the two treatment groups were comparable with regard to the effected reduction in anginal attacks and short acting nitrate consumption. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the amlodipine relative to the nifedipine group (11.5% vs 19.1%).\\ The results of this study show that once daily amlodipine offers comparable antianginal and antiischemic efficacy as twice daily sustained release nifedipine in the monotreatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. Given the lower incidence of adverse events with amlodipine and its convenient once daily dosing regimen, however, amlodipine may help to enhance patient compliance.},

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of chlorthalidone and diltiazem on myocardial ischemia.\\ Following a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol, we studied 15 elderly hypertensive patients aged 73.6+/-4.6 years with myocardial ischemia. All patients had angiographically documented coronary artery disease. We measured patients using 48- hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and exercise testing. After a 2-week period using placebo, patients received chlorthalidone or diltiazem for 4 weeks.\\ Both treatments lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The number of ischemic episodes on ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings was reduced with the use of chlorthalidone (2.5+/-3.8) and diltiazem (3.2+/-4.2) when compared with placebo (7.9+/-8.8; p<0.05). The total duration of ischemic episodes was reduced in both treatments when compared with placebo (chlorthalidone: 19.2+/-31.9min; diltiazem: 19.3+/-29.6min; placebo: 46.1+/-55.3min; p<0.05).\\ In elderly hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, chlorthalidone reduced myocardial ischemia similarly to diltiazem. This result is consistent with epidemiological studies and suggests that reduction of arterial blood pressure with thiazide therapy plays an important role in decreasing myocardial ischemia.},

   Abstract={The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of long-acting preparations of two commonly used calcium antagonists with particular reference to their effects on heart rate. Twenty patients with chronic stable angina were recruited to a double-blind, double-dummy crossover study of controlled-release diltiazem (diltiazem CR) versus sustained-release nifedipine (nifedipine SR) and underwent clinical assessment, symptom and adverse event reporting, and repeated treadmill exercise tests over a 10- to 11-week period. The main outcome measures were heart rate at rest and exercise, incidence of angina and nitroglycerin use, treadmill exercise performance (duration, time to angina, time to 1-mm ST-segment depression, heart rate at equivalent maximal exercise, and maximal ST-segment depression), and adverse events. Diltiazem CR significantly reduced heart rate at rest and equivalent exercise and incidence of angina and nitroglycerin use compared with nifedipine SR. Exercise duration time to angina and time to 1-mm ST-segment depression (but not maximal ST-segment depression) were all significantly improved by diltiazem CR. Diltiazem CR also caused significantly fewer adverse events than nifedipine SR. Calcium antagonists with negative chronotropic effects (eg, diltiazem CR) are safer and more efficacious as monotherapy in chronic stable angina than dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine SR) even when a long-acting formulation of the latter is used.},

   Abstract={The objective was to assess the effect ofverapamil on atrial fibrillation (AF) cycle length and spatial dispersion of refractoriness in patients with chronic AF.\\ Previous studies have suggested that verapamil prevents acute remodeling by AF. The effects of verapamil in chronic AF are unknown.\\ During electrophysiologic study in 15 patients with chronic AF (duration >1 year), 12 unipolar electrograms were recorded from right atrial free wall, right atrial appendage and coronary sinus, along with monophasic action potential recordings from the right atrial appendage. The mean fibrillatory interval at each atrial recording site was used as an index for local refractoriness. Dispersion of refractoriness was calculated as the standard deviation of all local mean fibrillatory intervals expressed as a percentage of the overall mean fibrillatory interval. After baseline measurements, verapamil (0.075 mg/kg intravenous in 10 min) was infused and the measurements were repeated.\\ After administration ofverapamil, mean fibrillatory intervals shortened by a mean of 16.6 +/- 3.3 ms (p < 0.001) at the right free wall, 15.0 +/- 3.5 ms (p < 0.001) at the appendage and 17.1 +/- 3.2 ms (p < 0.01) in the coronary sinus. Monophasic action potential duration decreased by 15.9 +/- 4.0 ms (p < 0.01). Dispersion of refractoriness increased in all patients from 3.8 +/- 0.8 to 5.1 +/- 1.8 (p < 0.001). A strong correlation between mean fibrillatory intervals and action potential duration was found, both before and after verapamil.\\ Verapamil caused shortening of refractoriness and increase in spatial dispersion of refractoriness in patients with chronic AF. This implies that verapamil is not useful in reversing the remodeling process in these patients.},

Active treatment was initiated with nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both, titrated or combined to reduce the sitting systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg, to less than 150 mmHg. The main outcome measures were serum creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance calculated by the formula of Cockroft and Gault.\\ Serum creatinine concentration at the time when participants were randomly allocated to study groups was less than 176.8 micromol/l (2.0 mg/dl), averaging 88 micromol/l. At the time of the last serum creatinine measurement, the blood pressure difference (P< 0.001) between the two groups was 11.6/4.1 mmHg. In the intention-to-treat analysis (11,427 patient-years), serum creatinine and the calculated creatinine clearance were not influenced by active treatment. However, in the patients assigned randomly to receive active treatment, the incidence of mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine at least 176.8 mmol/l) decreased by 64% (P= 0.04) and that of proteinuria by 33% (P= 0.03). Active treatment reduced the risk of proteinuria more in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients: by 71%, compared with 20% (P= 0.04). In non-proteinuric patients, active treatment did not influence serum creatinine, whereas in patients with proteinuria at entry to the study, serum creatinine decreased on active treatment (P< 0.001). Furthermore, in on-randomized treatment comparison stratified for risk at baseline, serum creatinine concentration did not change (P= 0.98) in patients continuing to receive monotherapy with nitrendipine, whereas it increased by 6.73 mmol/l (P < 0.001) in patients who received hydrochlorothiazide alone or in combination with other study medication (P < 0.001 for difference in trends).\\ In older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive treatment starting with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, nitrendipine, did not decrease blood pressure at the expense of renal function and prevented the development of proteinuria, especially in diabetic patients.},

   Abstract={Preventing subclinical organ damage is currently a major issue in the management of patients with essential hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs which act through different pathophysiological mechanisms might confer specific target organ protection beyond what is already provided by their blood pressure lowering effect.\\ Thirty-one patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive long-term treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine GITS, 90 mg/day) or an ACE-inhibitor (lisinopril, 20 mg/day). Blood pressure, left ventricular mass, carotid wall thickness and timed urinary albumin excretion were measured at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.\\ Both regimens significantly lowered mean blood pressure over the 24 months (from 124+/-2 to 103+/-2 mmHg in the lisinopril group and from 122+/-2 to 104+/-1 in the nifedipine group). Overall, end-organ damage improved with persistent blood pressure control. However, the two treatments had different specific effects. Lisinopril induced a more pronounced reduction of the left ventricular mass index (from 56+/-3 to 52+/-2 g/m2.7, P< 0.05) and urinary albumin excretion (from 34+/-15 to 9+/-2 microg/min, P< 0.01), while nifedipine achieved a greater reduction of carotid intima plus media thickness (from 0.8+/-0.06 to 0.6+/-0.06 mm, P< 0.01).\\ Blood pressure control does help reduce the severity of organ damage in patients with essential hypertension. Different antihypertensive treatments may confer additional specific cardiorenal and vascular protection regardless of blood pressure control. These data could be useful when devising individualized therapeutic strategies in high-risk hypertensive patients.},

   Abstract={Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that converting patients with stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications would improve their functional status, symptom control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life.\\ A single-blind randomized trial of 100 patients with stable coronary artery disease was performed in the outpatient clinic of a Veterans Affairs Health System. Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least 2 antianginal medications were studied. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments: optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or conversion to solely long-acting medications (long-acting diltiazem +/- nitroglycerin patches +/- atenolol) with subsequent optimization. The primary outcome was the 3-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. Although no differences in physical limitation scores were noted, patients randomized to receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control (3-month improvement in anginal stability [19.1 vs 5.6, P =.02] and anginal frequency [17.8 vs 5.5, P =.006]), more treatment satisfaction (3-month improvement of 8.2 vs 3.0, P =.057), and better quality of life (3-month improvement of 11.2 vs 5.6, P =.09) compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized. The improvement in symptom control was statistically significant.\\ Converting patients with chronic, stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications resulted in substantial improvements in symptom control with a trend toward better treatment satisfaction and quality of life.},

   Abstract={We tested the efficacy of two drug treatments, flecainide (F) and the combination ofdiltiazem and propranolol (D/P), administered as a single oral dose for termination of the arrhythmic episodes.\\ Both prophylactic drug therapy and catheter ablation are questionable as first-line treatments in patients with infrequent and well-tolerated episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).\\ Among 42 eligible patients (13% of all screened for SVT) with infrequent (< or =5/year), well-tolerated and long-lasting episodes, 37 were enrolled and 33 had SVT inducible during electrophysiological study. In the latter, three treatments (placebo, F, and D/P) were administered in a random order 5 min after SVT induction on three different days.\\ Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred within 2 h in 52%, 61%, and 94% of patients on placebo, F and D/P, respectively (p < 0.001). The conversion time was shorter after D/P (32 +/- 22 min) than after placebo (77 +/- 42 min, p < 0.001) or F (74 +/- 37 min, p < 0.001). Four patients (1 placebo, 1 D/P, and 2 F) had hypotension and four (3 D/P and 1 F) a sinus rate <50 beats/min following SVT interruption. Patients were discharged on a single oral dose of the most effective drug treatment (F or D/P) at time of acute testing. Twenty-six patients were discharged on D/P and five on F. During 17 +/- 12 months follow-up, the treatment was successful in 81% of D/P patients and in 80% of F patients, as all the arrhythmic episodes were interrupted out-of-hospital within 2 h. In the remaining patients, a failure occurred during one or more episodes because of drug ineffectiveness or drug unavailability. One patient had syncope after D/P ingestion. During follow-up, the percentage of patients calling for emergency room assistance was significantly reduced as compared to the year before enrollment (9% vs. 100%, p < 0.0001).\\ The episodic treatment with oral D/P and F, as assessed during acute testing, appears effective in the management of selected patients with SVT. This therapeutic strategy minimizes the need for emergency room admissions during tachycardia recurrences.},

Early to atrial filling ratio (E/A) was assessed by transmitral flow. Change from baseline of LVMI and E/A ratio was evaluated by repeated measurement analysis of the treatment effect in an intention-to-treat analysis.\\ Both amlodipine and lisinopril led to equivalent reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At the end of the study the amlodipine group led to LVMI decrease by 21.8 g/m < or = [95% confidence interval (CI), 18.3-25.3] and E/A ratio increased by 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05-0.11).

No statistically significant differences were found in changes in LVMI and E/A ratio between amlodipine and lisinopril.\\ A long-term study, the ELVERA trial proves that amlodipine and lisinopril reduce left ventricular mass and improve diastolic function to a similar extent in elderly newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.},

   Abstract={Association between raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) is well established and taken into account in guidelines on coronary prevention.\\ The relationship between risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and the levels of fasting plasma triglycerides was studied in the cohort of the Turkish Adult Risk Factor Study, a representative random sample of an adult population.\\ In 829 men and 907 women aged > or =27 years (mean 48.5+/-11), plasma lipids and lipoproteins were measured by the enzymatic dry method in the postabsorptive state. A sample of values was validated in a reference laboratory. Apoliprotein (apo) A-I and B were measured by the turbidimetric immunoassay using commercial kits in part of the cohort. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were made. Criteria for the diagnosis of CHD were based on history, cardiovascular examination, and Minnesota coding of resting electrocardiograms. Coronary heart disease was diagnosed in about 7% of the subjects. Participants were divided into four categories depending on their triglyceride levels: I = < 100 mg/dl (282 men, 400 women), II = 100-139 mg/dl (204 men, 228 women), III = 140-212 mg/dl (188 men, 180 women), and IV = > or = 212 mg/dl (155 men, 99 women).\\ After adjustment for age, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, smoking, and body mass index by logistic regression analysis, and after assigning the CHD risk of 1 to Category I, the relative risk for men and women combined rose to 1.42 in Category III (p<0.045) while it diminished to 0.94 in Category IV (p = 0.79). In women, the odds ratio (OR) rose gradually up to 1.78 (p< 0.025) in Category III, only to decline in Category IV. The OR in men was slightly, insignificantly, and equally elevated in Categories III and IV. Patients with CHD in Category III were not distinguished from those in Category IV by the studied risk parameters. It was suggested that high risk for CHD--particularly in subjects with slightly elevated or normal cholesterol levels-is often not reflected by extreme increases of fasting triglycerides but best by modest elevations (140-212 mg/dl), which serve better as a marker of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles. This knowledge may prove to be of value in population screening and individual risk assessment.},

   Abstract={There is no method available to predict the relative antianginal efficacy of beta blockers and calcium-channel antagonists. The present study was undertaken to assess the role of silent ischemic interval (SII) on exercise treadmill test (ETT) as a predictor of response to therapy with metoprolol and diltiazem in patients with stable angina.\\ Thirty-four patients with stable angina were divided into two groups depending upon the presence or absence of an SII gap of at least 1 min between onset of ST depression and appearance of angina on ETT. Metoprolol (50-100 mg twice daily) and diltiazem (60-120 mg three times daily) were randomly assigned for 6 weeks to patients in each group, and then patients were crossed over for further 6 weeks after a washout period of 2 weeks. Antianginal efficacy was assessed by clinical and exercise parameters.\\ In patients with SII, the clinical responder rate was better with metoprolol than with diltiazem (90 vs. 60%, respectively), and on ETT, metoprolol produced significant improvement in the total exercise time (p< 0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p <0.01), time to angina (p <0.01), and a significant decrease in peak rate-pressure product (p<0.001), whereas diltiazem had no significant effect on exercise parameters. However, in patients without SII, metoprolol and diltiazem had a similar clinical responder rate (57%), and both produced a significant increase in total exercise time (p < 0.01), time to 1 mm ST depression (p < 0.01), and time to angina (p < 0.01). In addition, metoprolol had a significant effect on peak rate-pressure product (p < 0.001).\\ Silent ischemic interval on ETT can be a predictor of response to antianginal therapy in stable angina, as patients with SII respond better to metoprolol and those without SII respond equally to both metoprolol and diltiazem.},

   Abstract={Hypertension is a common finding in patients > or =65 years of age that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but many patients are untreated or their hypertension inadequately controlled. Recent randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly.\\ This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in elderly (> or =65 years of age) patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg).\\ This was an open-label, multicenter, 10-week, general-practice study involving patients >18 years of age. Patients with malignant or secondary hypertension or unstable angina were excluded, as were those who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction or stroke in the preceding 3 months or had been treated with an alpha-blocker in the preceding 6 months. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment schedules: amlodipine monotherapy or combination therapy and amlodipine given once daily in the morning or in the evening. Approximately 50% of patients would receive a morning dose, and approximately 80% would receive amlodipine as monotherapy. The paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences from baseline values, with significance set at P < 0.05.\\ A total of 5135 patients received amlodipine and were included in the tolerability analysis. Of these, 3511 of 3628 patients (96.8%) <65 years and 1471 of 1507 patients (97.6%) > or =65 years (including 336 of 349 [96.3%] > or =75 years) were included in the efficacy analysis. Significant reductions (P < 0.05) in blood pressure were noted in all groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The equivalence of efficacy in all age groups was seen in terms of reduction in blood pressure (reduction of 21/15 mm Hg in patients <65 years of age, 25/16 mm Hg in those > or =65 years of age, and 26/17 mm Hg in those > or =75 years of age) compared with baseline. Therapy was successful in 2878 patients (82.0%) <65 years of age, in 1238 patients (84.2%) > or =65 years of age, and in 284 patients (84.5%) > or =75 years of age. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all age groups (18.0%, <65 years; 22.3%, > or =65 years; and 24.1%, > or =75 years), with no statistically significant differences between groups. Tolerability was rated as good or excellent in all patients, with no significant differences between groups.\\ Once-daily amlodipine was effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in this patient population and demonstrated a low frequency of adverse events, a high degree of tolerability, and improved well-being. Morning rather than evening dosing appeared to confer a slight advantage.},

   Abstract={Verapamil (VER), a potent calcium channel blocker, has been found to overcome P-gp-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR) and to increase sensitivity to cytotoxic anticancer drugs in refractory myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The value of VER for treating solid tumors is still a matter for debate.\\ We performed a prospective study in 99 patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC), to assess the clinical effect of oral VER given in association with chemotherapy. Instead of retreating patients with anthracycline, we used a partially noncross-resistant regimen (VF), combining vindesine (VDS) and 5-fluorouracil given as a continuous infusion (5-FU CI). Patients were randomly assigned to two cohorts. One cohort (47 patients) was treated in 28-day cycles, each involving the administration of VDS (3 mg/m2 i.v. bolus on days 1 and 10) and 5-FU CI, (400 mg/m2/day i.v. from day 1 to day 10). The other cohort (52 patients) received the same VDS and 5-FU treatment and an additional oral VER treatment (240 mg/day divided in 2 doses), from day 1 to day 28 of each cycle. Patients were treated until progression.\\ The treatment was well tolerated and no side effects that could be attributed to VER were detected. Patients treated with VER had longer overall survival (OS) (median OS: 323 vs. 209 days, P = 0.036) and a higher response rate (27% vs. 11%, P = 0.04) than those not given VER. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also longer but the difference was not statistically significant (median PFS: 4.6 and 2.7 months for the VER and non-VER groups respectively, P = 0.6).\\ This clinical trial demonstrates that a chemosensitizer, such as VER, can increase the survival of MBC patients with acquired anthracycline resistance.},

   Abstract={Ultrasonographic assessments of intima-media thickness and plaques in the carotid artery are widely used as surrogate markers for coronary atherosclerosis, but prospective evaluations are scarce and appear to be lacking in patients with coronary artery disease. Ultrasonographic evaluations of femoral vascular changes have not been studied prospectively.\\ In the Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS), 809 patients with stable angina pectoris were studied prospectively during double-blind treatment with verapamil or metoprolol. Ultrasonographic assessments of intima-media thickness, lumen diameter and plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries were evaluated in a subgroup of 558 patients (182 females) with a mean age of 60 +/-7 years, and related to the risk of cardiovascular death (n = 18) or non-fatal myocardial infarction (n = 26), or revascularization (n = 70) during follow-up (median 3.0 years). Univariate Cox regression analyses showed that carotid intima-media thickness and plaques were related to the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness was related to cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, as well as to revascularization, whereas femoral plaques were only related to the latter. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, previous cardiovascular disease and lipid status, carotid intima-media thickness failed to predict any cardiovascular event, whereas carotid plaques tended (P = 0.056) to predict the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Femoral intima-media thickness (P < 0.01) and plaques (P < 0.05) were also related to the risk of revascularization after adjustments.\\ Carotid and femoral vascular changes were differently related to cardiovascular events. Carotid intima-media thickness was a weak predictor of events, whereas femoral intima-media thickness predicted revascularization.

   Abstract={This programme of overviews of randomised trials was established to investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering drugs on mortality and major cardiovascular morbidity in several populations of patients. We did separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo, trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes.\\ The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included, and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques.\\ The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary heart disease (20% [11-28]), and major cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13-41]). In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of different intensity (three trials, 20,408 patients with hypertension), there were reduced risks of stroke (20% [2-35]), coronary heart disease (19% [2-33]), and major cardiovascular events (15% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In the overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance.\\ Strong evidence of benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available about any real differences that might exist between regimens.},

   Abstract={Several observational studies and individual randomised trials in hypertension have suggested that, compared with other drugs, calcium antagonists may be associated with a higher risk of coronary events, despite similar blood-pressure control. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular events.\\ We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years.\\ The nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. Calcium antagonists and other drugs achieved similar control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those assigned calcium antagonists (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). The treatment differences were within the play of chance for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0.54).\\ In randomised controlled trials, the large available database suggests that calcium antagonists are inferior to other types of antihypertensive drugs as first-line agents in reducing the risks of several major complications of hypertension. On the basis of these data, the longer-acting calcium antagonists cannot be recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension.},

   Abstract={Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is believed by many physicians to be superior to rate control only. However, there are no prospective data that compare both therapeutic strategies.\\ The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was a randomised trial in 252 patients with atrial fibrillation of between 7 days and 360 days duration, which compared rate (group A, 125 patients) with rhythm control (group B, 127 patients). In group A, diltiazem was used as first-line therapy and amiodarone was used in group B. The primary study endpoint was improvement in symptoms related to atrial fibrillation.\\ Over the entire observation period of 1 year, a similar proportion of patients reported improvement in symptoms in both groups (76 responders at 12 months in group A vs 70 responders in group B, p=0.317). Amiodarone administration resulted in pharmacological restoration of sinus rhythm in 23% of patients. Walking distance in a 6 min walk test was better in group B compared with group A, but assessment of quality of life showed no differences between groups. The incidence of hospital admission was higher in group B (87 [69%] out of 127 vs 30 [24%] out of 125 in group A, p=0.001). Adverse drug effects more frequently led to a change in therapy in group B (31 [25%] patients compared with 17 [14%] in group A, p=0.036).\\ With respect to symptomatic improvement in patients with atrial fibrillation, the therapeutic strategies of rate versus rhythm control yielded similar clinical results overall. However, exercise tolerance is better with rhythm control, although hospital admission is more frequent. These data may serve as a basis to select therapy in individual patients.},

   Abstract={The basic cause of angina pectoris is imbalance between the metabolic needs of the myocardium and the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver sufficient oxygenated blood to satisfy these needs.\\ The study was undertaken to evaluate whether the effect of combined amlodipine and atenolol therapy on patients with stable angina pectoris and with ST-depression during exercise testing and 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is superior to that of either agent given alone.\\ Patients with stable angina pectoris and ST depression during exercise and ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 116) or atenolol (n = 116), or both (n = 119). All patients were also treated with short- and long-acting nitrates. The design was a double-blind, randomized, triple-arm parallel group study with 10 weeks of administration of the test medication.\\ In terms of time to onset of ST depression > 1 mm, time to onset of angina, total exercise time, maximum achieved workload, and peak intensity of angina, amlodipine and atenolol alone were as effective as their combination. During ambulatory monitoring, atenolol was more effective than amlodipine regarding total time and number of ST-depression episodes, and as effective as the combined drugs.\\ For individual patients with stable angina pectoris, combination of a beta blocker with a calcium antagonist is not necessarily more effective than either drug given alone.},

   Abstract={The results of angiographic studies have suggested that calcium channel-blocking agents may prevent new coronary lesion formation, the progression of minimal lesions, or both.\\ The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT) was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial designed to test whether amlodipine would slow the progression of early coronary atherosclerosis in 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. The primary outcome was the average 36-month angiographic change in mean minimal diameters of segments with a baseline diameter stenosis of 30%. A secondary hypothesis was whether amlodipine would reduce the rate of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries as assessed with B-mode ultrasonography, which measured intimal-medial thicknesses (IMT). The rates of clinical events were also monitored. The placebo and amlodipine groups had nearly identical average 36-month reductions in the minimal diameter: 0.084 versus 0.095 mm, respectively (P:=0.38). In contrast, amlodipine had a significant effect in slowing the 36-month progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis: the placebo group experienced a 0.033-mm increase in IMT, whereas there was a 0. 0126-mm decrease in the amlodipine group (P:=0.007). There was no treatment difference in the rates of all-cause mortality or major cardiovascular events, although amlodipine use was associated with fewer cases of unstable angina and coronary revascularization.\\ Amlodipine has no demonstrable effect on angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but is associated with fewer hospitalizations for unstable angina and revascularization.},

   Abstract={The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of antihypertensive therapy on clinic (CBP) and ambulatory (ABP) blood pressures, on ECG voltages, and on the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events in older patients with sustained and nonsustained systolic hypertension.\\ Patients who were >/=60 years old, with systolic CBP of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic CBP of <95 mm Hg, were randomized into the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine, with the possible addition of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, or both. Patients enrolled in the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Side Project were classified according to daytime systolic ABP into 1 of 3 subgroups: nonsustained hypertension (<140 mm Hg), mild sustained hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg), and moderate sustained hypertension (>/=160 mm Hg). At baseline, patients with nonsustained hypertension had smaller ECG voltages (P<0.001) and, during follow-up, a lower incidence of stroke (P<0.05) and of cardiovascular complications (P=0.01) than other groups. Active treatment reduced ABP and CBP in patients with sustained hypertension but only CBP in patients with nonsustained hypertension (P<0.001). The influence of active treatment on ECG voltages (P<0.05) and on the incidence of stroke (P<0.05) and cardiovascular events (P=0.06) was more favorable than that of placebo only in patients with moderate sustained hypertension.\\ Patients with sustained hypertension had higher ECG voltages and rates of cardiovascular complications than did patients with nonsustained hypertension. The favorable effects of active treatment on these outcomes were only statistically significant in patients with moderate sustained hypertension.},

Patients had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. We randomly assigned patients nifedipine 30 mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg [corrected] plus amiloride 2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. Analysis was done by intention to treat.\\ Primary outcomes occurred in 200 (6.3%) patients in the nifedipine group and in 182 (5.8%) in the co-amilozide group (18.2 vs 16.5 events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.10 [95% CI 0.91-1.34], p=0.35). Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg (12/7). There was an 8% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly non-vascular (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80% of the primary events occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147 co-amilozide, difference 0.33% [-0.7 to 1.4]).\\ Nifedipine once daily and co-amilozide were equally effective in preventing overall cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications.

   Abstract={The purpose of this study was to address the timing of sudden death in advanced heart failure patients.\\ Sudden death is a catastrophic event in cardiovascular disease. It has a circadian pattern prominent in the early AM, which has been thought to be due to a surge of sympathetic stimulation. We postulated that the distribution of events in advanced heart failure, with chronic sympathetic activation, would be more uniform implicating other potential mechanisms.\\ We analyzed data from Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Trial (PRAISE). Sudden deaths were analyzed by time of death in 4-h and 1-h blocks for uniformity of distribution in the entire cohort, and in the prespecified ischemic and nonischemic stratum. Further analyses were undertaken in the treatment groups of amlodipine and placebo, and among those receiving background therapy of aspirin and warfarin.\\ Sudden deaths in the overall cohort showed a nonuniform distribution with a PM peak but not an AM peak. The ischemic stratum also showed a PM peak, but sudden deaths within the nonischemic stratum were uniformly distributed. Neither amlodipine treatment nor aspirin or warfarin use altered the distribution.\\ Sudden death in advanced heart failure did not show an AM peak, suggesting that circadian sympathetic activation did not strongly influence these events. The PM peak noted is likely complex in origin and was not affected by antiischemic or antithrombotic medications.},

   Abstract={Reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system by short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists has been reported to harm hypertensive patients. Different neurohormonal profiles and their response to treatment may influence the effectiveness of dihydropyridine vasodilator treatment of heart failure.\\ Four hundred fifty men with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction were administered standard heart failure treatment and felodipine extended release (ER) or placebo in the Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial III (V-HeFT III). Plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, exercise capacity, LV ejection fraction (EF), cardiac dimensions and function, and arrhythmia frequency were measured. Hospital-free survival for baseline neurohormonal classes was assessed.\\ Distributions of ANP and PNE levels at baseline in patients with heart failure of ischemic and nonischemic causes were virtually identical. ANP levels at baseline were inversely related to LVEF (r = -0.39; P = .0001), exercise duration (r = -0.19; P = .0001), and peak oxygen consumption (r = -0.27; P = .008) and directly related to LV (r = 0.23; P = .0006) and right ventricular dilatation (r = 0.23; P = .0008). The increase in ANP levels between baseline and 3 months (P = .02) and 1 year (P = .03) was significantly less in the felodipine-ER group than in the placebo group, but PNE levels did not differ between treatment groups. Hospital-free survival was directly related to baseline ANP (P = .0002) and PNE levels (P = .004). All-cause mortality was related to baseline PNE levels (P = .02) but not baseline ANP levels.\\ Levels of ANP and PNE hormones are related to LV dysfunction, exercise performance, and hospital-free survival in heart failure and PNE levels are related to all-cause mortality. Treatment with felodipine ER did not adversely affect survival in any neurohormone subclass.},

   Abstract={To compare the effect of enalapril with long-acting nifedipine on orthostatic hypotension in older patients.\\ A prospective, double blinded, cross-over study.\\ The outpatient clinic of a university hospital.\\ Thirty-nine patients aged 65 years or older with systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140-190 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90-110 mm Hg.\\ Enalapril 5-20 mg od or nifedipine 30-90 mg od for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks washout and cross-over for a second 8-week period.\\ Supine and standing 0-, 1-, and 5-minutes blood pressure was recorded before and at the end of each treatment period.\\ At baseline, SBP was 158.8 +/- 8.7 mm Hg, and DBP was 97.1 +/- 5.9 mm Hg. There was a decline in SBP of 6.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg and 8.4 +/- 4.1 mm Hg after 1 and 5 minutes of standing, respectively. Both agents caused a significant decline in supine blood pressure. Enalapril: supine SBP 158.8 +/- 8.7 to 143 +/- 7.3 mm Hg; supine DBP 97.1 +/- 5.9 to 85.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (P = .0001). The drop in SBP after standing for 5 minutes was only 2.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg with no change in diastolic values. A > or = 10 mm Hg drop in SBP was observed in only three patients, and no patient experienced a decline of 20 mm Hg or more. Nifedipine: supine SBP: 160.3 +/- 9 to 145.3 +/- 8.1 mm Hg; supine DBP: 96.3 +/- 5.7 to 86.3 +/- 5.8 (P = .0001). Nifedipine induced an orthostatic decline in SBP values; there was an 8.7 +/- 4.8 mm Hg difference between supine and 5 minutes standing values (P = .0005) without change in diastolic values. An orthostatic decline in SBP of > or = 10 mm Hg occurred in 13 patients, and there was a drop of > or = 20 mm Hg in six patients. The cross-over of enalapril and nifedipine reproduced the hypotensive effect and reversed the postural effect. (P = .0002 nifedipine vs enalapril)\\ Enalapril and nifedipine were equipotent in reducing supine blood pressure levels. Enalapril also reduced the number of orthostatic episodes significantly, whereas nifedipine aggravated this phenomenon.},

   Abstract={A recent report has raised concern that nifedipine may be associated with an increased risk of aplastic anaemia. This large population-based study evaluated the risk of idiopathic aplastic anaemia in users of calcium channel blockers compared with that of other antihypertensive drugs.\\ The study was based on information derived from the General Practice Research Database. We conducted a follow-up study with a nested case-control analysis of 322 448 subjects who received antihypertensive drugs. Cases were people who had a first-time diagnosis of aplastic anaemia during January 1, 1988 through September 30, 1997. The risk estimate of aplastic anaemia was calculated for all antihypertensive drugs. For the nested case-control analysis, six controls were matched to each case on age, sex and general practice attended. Odds ratios compared the risk of idiopathic aplastic anaemia for all antihypertensive drugs relative to nonusers.\\ There were 13 cases of newly diagnosed idiopathic aplastic anaemia. The estimated risk of aplastic anaemia per 100 000 users was 0.8 (95% CI 0.1, 4.7) for calcium channel blockers, 1.4 (95% CI 0.5, 4.1) for beta-adrenoceptor blockers, 2.3 (95% CI 0.6, 8.6) for angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 5.9 (95% CI 1.6, 21.5) for users of other antihypertensive drugs. In the case-control analysis of 13 cases and 77 controls, the odds ratio was 0.3 (95% CI 0.02, 3.3) for calcium channel blockers, 0.5 (95% CI 0.1, 2.5) for beta-adrenoceptor blockers, 0.7 (95% CI 0.1, 5.6) for ACE inhibitors, 1.2 (95% CI 0.1, 11.8) for users of other antihypertensive drugs and 0.7 (95% CI 0.1, 7.2) for users of multiple drugs with a calcium channel blocker compared with nonusers.\\ The present study suggests that the use of calcium channel blockers is not associated with an increased risk of aplastic anaemia.},

   Abstract={Despite the high success rate of radiofrequency (RF) ablation, pharmacologic therapy is still considered the standard initial therapeutic approach for atrial flutter.\\ We prospectively compared the outcome at follow-up of patients with atrial flutter randomly assigned to drug therapy or RF ablation.\\ Patients with at least two episodes of symptomatic atrial flutter in the last four months were randomized to regimens of either antiarrhythmic drug therapy or first-line RF ablation. After institution of therapy, end points included recurrence of atrial flutter, rehospitalization and quality of life.\\ A total of 61 patients entered the study, 30 of whom were randomized to drug therapy and 31 to RF ablation. After a mean follow-up of 21 +/- 11 months, 11 of 30 (36%) patients receiving drugs were in sinus rhythm, versus 25 of 31 (80%) patients who underwent RF ablation (p < 0.01). Of the patients receiving drugs, 63% required one or more rehospitalizations, whereas post-RF ablation, only 22% of patients were rehospitalized (p < 0.01). Following RF ablation, 29% of patients developed atrial fibrillation which was seen in 53% of patients receiving medications (p < 0.05). Sense of well being (pre-RF 2.0 +/- 0.3 vs. post-RF 3.8 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01) and function in daily life (pre-RF 2.3 +/- 0.4 vs. post-RF 3.6 +/- 0.6, p < 0.01) improved after ablation, but did not change significantly in patients treated with drugs.\\ In a selected group of patients with atrial flutter, RF ablation could be considered a first-line therapy due to the better success rate and impact on quality of life, the lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation and the lower need for rehospitalization at follow-up.},

   Abstract={To evaluate the prognostic implications of results from exercise testing, and of antianginal treatment among patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.\\ Out of 809 patients in the Angina Prognosis Study In Stockholm (APSIS), 731 (511 men) performed evaluable exercise tests before and after 1 month on double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil. During a median follow-up of 40 months, 32 patients suffered a cardiovascular death and 29 a non-fatal myocardial infarction.\\ Prognostic implications of results from exercise tests were assessed in a multivariate Cox model which included sex, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Maximal ST-segment depression, especially if >/=2 mm and occurring after exercise, as well as exercise duration independently predicted cardiovascular death. Similar results were obtained for the combined end-point of cardiovascular death+myocardial infarction. Among patients with a positive exercise test at baseline, verapamil reduced the maximal ST-depression more markedly than metoprolol (P<0. 01). However, when the treatment given and treatment effects on ST-segment depression were added to the Cox model, no impact on prognosis could be detected for either cardiovascular death alone or combined with myocardial infarction. Anginal pain carried no prognostic information.\\ Marked ST-segment depression during and after exercise, and a low exercise capacity independently predicted an adverse outcome in patients with stable angina pectoris, whereas anginal symptoms had no predictive value. Short-term treatment effects on ischaemia did not seem to influence prognosis. Post-exercise ischaemia should be examined carefully when evaluating patients with stable angina pectoris.},

Patient recruitment was started in Norway and Sweden in September 1992, and ended on December 15, 1996, when 10.896 male and female patients, aged 50-74 years, with essential hypertension had been randomized. In this paper we describe the baseline data of the patient cohort and blood pressures achieved in the two treatment groups during the early part of the study. The patient cohort consists of 5294 males and 5602 females with a mean age of 59.6 and 60.3 years, respectively. Concomitant disorders and risk factors in the cohort are: smoking 22%, ischemic heart disease 3.0%, previous myocardial infarction (MI) 2.0%, previous stroke 1.5%, diabetes mellitus 7.0%, and renal impairment 0.3%. There were no differences between the treatment groups in these respects. The blood pressure treatment goal is a target diastolic blood pressure of < or =90 mmHg or a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction from the inclusion pressure. In the treatment group randomized to a diltiazem-based treatment strategy, blood pressure was 174/106 mmHg at baseline and 156/90 mmHg after 12 months of follow-up on active treatment. In the group randomized to a conventional treatment strategy, baseline blood pressure at randomization was 173/106 mmHg and 153/90 mmHg after 12 months on active therapy. The NORDIL study will terminate on October 31, 1999 and the final results should be available by mid-2000.},

   Abstract={The echocardiographic substudy of the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial III (V-HeFT III) aimed to determine if felodipine treatment in patients with heart failure who were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor had a favorable effect on left ventricular (LV) structure and function. Earlier V-HeFT trials showed that hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate improved ejection fraction (EF) and survival, whereas enalapril achieved greater survival with smaller increases in EF. Would the combination of a potent vasodilator and enalapril produce greater improvements in function and survival?\\ Doppler-echocardiographic data were collected from 260 males with heart failure who were randomized to felodipine or a placebo. Mean intrasubject differences between baseline, at 3 months, and at 12 months were compared. Intersite and intrareader reproducibilities were measured from duplicate recordings and readings. At 3 months, no changes in ultrasound variables from baseline occurred in either group. At 12 months, felodipine patients achieved greater increases in EF, shortening of LV end-systolic length, and increases in stroke volume index. Reproducibility coefficients of variation were 7.4% (EF), 6.0% (end-diastolic length), and 13.0% (stroke volume index).\\ The echocardiographic substudy showed that felodipine, added to heart failure therapy, increased EF, shortened end-systolic length, and increased stroke volume index. The changes were small and confirmed that reproducibility from multiple laboratories can be coordinated into a useful research tool.},

   Abstract={Our intent was to investigate the effect of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine on restenosis and clinical outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).\\ Amlodipine has sustained vasodilatory effects and relieves coronary spasm, which may reduce luminal loss and clinical complications after PTCA.\\ In a prospective, double-blind design, 635 patients were randomized to 10 mg of amlodipine or placebo. Pretreatment with the study drug started two weeks before PTCA and continued until four months after PTCA. The primary angiographic end point was loss in minimal lumen diameter (MLD) from post-PTCA to follow-up, as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Clinical end points were death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and repeat PTCA (major adverse clinical events).\\ Angioplasty was performed in 585 patients (92.1%); 91 patients (15.6%) had coronary stents implanted. Follow-up angiography suitable for QCA analysis was done in 236 patients in the amlodipine group and 215 patients in the placebo group (per-protocol group). The mean loss in MLD was 0.30 +/- 0.45 mm in the amlodipine group versus 0.29 +/- 0.49 mm in the placebo group (p = 0.84). The need for repeat PTCA was significantly lower in the amlodipine versus the placebo group (10 [3.1%] vs. 23 patients [7.3%], p = 0.02, relative risk ratio [RR]: 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22 to 0.91), and the composite incidence of clinical events (30 [9.4%] vs. 46 patients (14.5%), p = 0.049, RR: 0.65, CI: 0.43 to 0.99) within the four months follow-up period (intention-to-treat analysis).\\ Amlodipine therapy starting two weeks before PTCA did not reduce luminal loss, but the incidence of repeat PTCA and the composite major adverse clinical events were significantly reduced during the four-month follow-up period after PTCA with amlodipine as compared with placebo.},

The goal diastolic pressure was < or =90 mm Hg and to achieve this, double-blind medication could be doubled (5/10 mg bisoprolol, 40/80 mg nifedipine retard) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (unblinded) could be added to the higher dose. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 309 subjects in both the bisoprolol and nifedipine retard treated group provided at least a baseline and a second quality of life assessment (82%). An excess of symptoms was observed in the nifedipine group for oedema of the legs, nocturia, constipation, racing heart and heart thumping. Fewer patients reported wheeze in the nifedipine group. For quality of life, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups after 8 weeks. However, when analysing the results of the last available assessment (usually at 24 weeks) there were significant (P < 0.05) improvements in tension/anxiety, anger/ hostility, vigour/activity, and confusion/bewilderment, assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in patients receiving bisoprolol in comparison to those receiving nifedipine retard. The Sickness Impact Profile and objective tests of cognitive function did not differ statistically between the two groups. Quality of life was maintained at a good level on both treatments with advantages for bisoprolol in certain areas. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 205-212.},

   Abstract={A preliminary study suggested that the long-acting late-generation calcium-channel blocker amlodipine has favorable effects on exercise tolerance and is safe to use in heart failure, in contrast to earlier generation agents. The goal of 2 multicenter studies was to assess the effect of adjunctive therapy with amlodipine in addition to standard therapy on exercise capacity, quality of life, left ventricular function, and safety parameters in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\\ Two large multicenter trials examining the effects of amlodipine on these parameters over a 12-week period of therapy were undertaken in patients with mild to moderate heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A total of 437 patients with stable heart failure were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective design.\\ Amlodipine at a dose of 10 mg/day in addition to standard therapy in such patients was associated with no significant difference in change in exercise tolerance on a Naughton protocol compared with placebo in each trial. Among all patients taking amlodipine, exercise time increased 53 +/- 9 (SE) seconds; exercise time for those taking placebo increased 66 +/- 9 seconds (P = not significant). There were no significant differences in changes of quality of life parameters between amlodipine- and placebo-treated patients, and there were no significant differences in symptom scores or New York Heart Association classification between groups. Left ventricular function (measured as ejection fraction) improved 3. 4% +/- 0.5% in amlodipine-treated patients and 1.5% +/- 0.5% in placebo-treated patients (P =.007). There was no statistically significant excess of important adverse events (episodes of worsening heart failure in 10% amlodipine-treated vs 6.3% of placebo-treated patients) or differences in need for changes in background medication between groups.\\ The addition of 10 mg of amlodipine per day to standard therapy in patients with heart failure is associated with no significant improvement in exercise time compared with placebo therapy over a 12-week period, and there was no increased incidence of adverse events. These data suggest that the addition of amlodipine to standard therapy in heart failure will not result in additional efficacy per se beyond standard therapy.},

   Abstract={Our goal was to determine what drugs are most efficacious for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation.\\ We conducted a systematic review of the literature published before May 1998, beginning with searches of The Cochrane Collaboration's CENTRAL database and MEDLINE.\\ We included English-language articles describing randomized controlled trials of drugs used for heart rate control in adults with atrial fibrillation.\\ Abstracts of trials were reviewed independently by 2 members of the study team. We reviewed English-language abstracts of non-English-language publications to assess qualitative consistency with our results.\\ Forty-five articles evaluating 17 drugs met our criteria for review. In the 5 trials of verapamil and 5 of diltiazem, heart rate was reduced significantly (P <.05), both at rest and with exercise, compared with placebo, with equivalent or improved exercise tolerance in 6 of 7 comparisons. In 7 of 12 comparisons of a beta-blocker with placebo, the beta-blocker was efficacious for control of resting heart rate, with evidence that the effect is drug specific, as nadolol and atenolol proved to be most efficacious. All 9 comparisons demonstrated good heart rate control with beta-blockers during exercise, although exercise tolerance was compromised in 3 of 9 comparisons. In 7 of 8 trials, digoxin administered alone slowed the resting heart rate more than placebo, but it did not significantly slow the rate during exercise in 4 studies. The trials evaluating other drugs yielded insufficient evidence to support their use, but those drugs may yet be promising.\\ The calcium-channel blockers verapamil or diltiazem, or select beta-blockers are efficacious for heart rate control at rest and during exercise for patients with atrial fibrillation without a clinically important decrease in exercise tolerance. Digoxin is useful when rate control during exercise is less a concern.},

   Abstract={The efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) has been well established for patients with preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD). However, limited information is available assessing the extent to which these medications are prescribed in academic medical centers.\\ The use of LLT for patients with CAD was prospectively evaluated in 825 men and women who were recruited from 16 academic medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in the Prospective Evaluation of the Vascular Events of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT). The assessment of LLT use during the 3-year trial was evaluated in patients receiving amlodipine therapy and placebo; levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to assess the impact of LLT.\\ Despite a baseline prevalence of LLT in 42% of men (38% in 1994), half of the patients had high levels of LDL-C (>3.36 mmol [>130 mg/dL]). During the subsequent 3 years, the prevalence of elevated LDL-C levels dropped in men (29%) but remained stagnant in women (48%). These changes were associated with increased LLT in men (55%) but not in women (35%) (P = .04). In 1994, the LDL-C target goal (<2.59 mmol/L [<100 mg/dL]) was attained in 17% of men and 6% of women (P = .006). At study completion in 1997, the LDL-C target goal was achieved in 31% of men and only 12% of women (P = .001).\\ This study highlights the relatively low treatment rates of hyperlipidemia among patients with CAD overall and women in particular who were participating in a clinical trial at academic medical centers in the United States and Canada. Because LLT has been proven to reduce future cardiovascular events, these results suggest that more intensive efforts should be promoted in order to maximize CAD reduction.},

   Abstract={Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.\\ In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than those treated with calcium channel-blocking agents. However, the long-term renal effects of ACE inhibitors in these patients remain inconclusive. In 1989, we commenced a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to examine the anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril versus nifedipine (slow release) in 102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients. These patients have been followed up for a mean trial duration of 5.5 +/- 2.2 years. We examined the determinants, including the effect of ACE inhibition on clinical outcomes in these patients.\\ After a six-week placebo-controlled, run-in period, 52 patients were randomized double-blind to receive nifedipine (slow release) and 50 patients to receive enalapril. After the one-year analysis, which confirmed the superior anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril (-54%) over nifedipine (+11%), all patients were continued on their previously assigned treatment with informed consent. They were subdivided into normoalbuminuric (N = 43), microalbuminuric (N = 34), and macroalbuminuric (N = 25) groups based on two of three 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) measurements during the run-in period. Renal function was shown by the 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr), and the regression coefficient of the yearly plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr). Clinical endpoints were defined as death, cardiovascular events, and/or renal events (need for renal replacement therapy or doubling of baseline plasma creatinine).\\ In the whole group, patients treated with enalapril were more likely to revert to being normoalbuminuric (23.8 vs. 15.4%), and fewer of them developed macroalbuminuria (19.1 vs. 30.8%) compared with the nifedipine-treated patients (P < 0.05). In the microalbuminuric group, treatment with enalapril (N = 21) was associated with a 13.0% (P < 0.01) reduction in 24-hour UAE compared with a 17.3% increase in the nifedipine group (N = 13). In the macroalbuminuric patients, enalapril treatment (N = 11) was associated with stabilization compared with a decline in renal function in the nifedipine group, as shown by the beta-1/Cr (0.65 +/- 4.29 vs. -1.93 +/- 2.35 1/micromol x 10-3, P < 0.05) after adjustment for baseline values. Compared with the normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients, those with macroalbuminuria had the lowest mean CCr (75.5 +/- 24.1 vs. 63.5 +/- 21.3 vs. 41.9 +/- 18.5 mL/min, P < 0.001) and the highest frequency of clinical events (4.7 vs. 5.9 vs. 52%, P < 0. 001). On multivariate analysis, beta-1/Cr (R2 = 0.195, P < 0.001) was independently associated with baseline HbA1c (beta = -0.285, P = 0.004), whereas clinical outcomes (R2 = 0.176, P < 0.001) were independently related to the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 2.426, P = 0.018), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -8.797, P = 0.03), baseline UAE (beta = 0.002, P = 0.04), and mean CCr during treatment (beta = -0.211, P = 0.006).\\ In this prospective cohort analysis involving 102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of albuminuria followed up for a mean duration of five years, we observed the importance of good metabolic and blood pressure control on the progression of albuminuria and renal function. Treatment with enalapril was associated with a greater reduction in albuminuria than with nifedipine in the entire patient group, and especially in those with microalbuminuria. In the macroalbuminuric patients, the rate of deterioration in renal function was also attenuated by treatment with enalapril.},

Patients were randomly assigned conventional antihypertensive drugs (atenolol 50 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, pindolol 5 mg, or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride 2.5 mg daily) or newer drugs (enalapril 10 mg or lisinopril 10 mg, or felodipine 2.5 mg or isradipine 2-5 mg daily). We assessed fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, and other fatal cardiovascular disease. Analysis was by intention to treat.\\ Blood pressure was decreased similarly in all treatment groups. The primary combined endpoint of fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, and other fatal cardiovascular disease occurred in 221 of 2213 patients in the conventional drugs group (19.8 events per 1000 patient-years) and in 438 of 4401 in the newer drugs group (19.8 per 1000; relative risk 0.99 [95% CI 0.84-1.16], p=0.89). The combined endpoint of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular mortality occurred in 460 patients taking conventional drugs and in 887 taking newer drugs (0.96 [0.86-1.08], p=0.49).\\ Old and new antihypertensive drugs were similar in prevention of cardiovascular mortality or major events. Decrease in blood pressure was of major importance for the prevention of cardiovascular events.},

   Abstract={The prognostic significance of ambulatory ischemia, alone and in relation to ischemia during exercise was assessed in 686 patients (475 men) with chronic stable angina pectoris taking part in the Angina Prognosis Study In Stockholm (APSIS), who had 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic registrations and exercise tests at baseline (n = 678) and after 1 month (n = 607) of double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil. Ambulatory electrocardiograms were analyzed for ventricular premature complexes and ST-segment depression. During a median follow-up of 40 months, 29 patients died of cardiovascular (CV) causes, 27 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 89 underwent revascularization. Patients with CV death had more episodes (median 5 vs. 1; p<0.01) and longer median duration (24 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.01) of ST-segment depression than patients without events. For those who had undergone revascularization, the duration was also longer (12 vs. 3 minutes; p<0.05). In a multivariate Cox model including sex, history of previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes, the duration of ST-segment depression independently predicted CV death. When exercise testing was included, ambulatory ischemia carried additional prognostic information only among patients with ST-segment depression > or =2 mm during exercise. When the treatment given and treatment effects on ambulatory ischemia were added to the Cox model, no significant impact on prognosis was found. Ventricular premature complexes carried no prognostic information. Thus, in patients with stable angina pectoris, ischemia during ambulatory monitoring showed independent prognostic importance regarding CV death. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise testing provide complementary information, but only among patients with marked ischemia during exercise. Treatment reduced ambulatory ischemia, but the short-term treatment effects did not significantly influence prognosis.},

Patients were randomly assigned to 20 mg of sustained-release nicardipine hydrochloride twice daily or 2 mg of trichlormethiazide once daily by the double-dummy method and followed up for 5 years. A total of 414 patients were analyzed: 204 in the nicardipine group and 210 in the diuretic group.

   Abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be initiated by ectopic beats originating from the atrial or great venous tissues. This study investigated the anatomic characteristics and electrophysiological properties of pulmonary veins (PVs), as well as the possible mechanisms and response to drugs of ectopic foci, and assessed the effects of radiofrequency (RF) ablation on AF initiated by ectopic beats originating from PVs.\\ Seventy-nine patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients were included. Distal PVs showed the shortest effective refractory periods (ERPs), and right superior PVs showed a higher incidence of intra-PV conduction block than left superior PVs. Superior and left PVs had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior and right PVs, respectively. These electrophysiological characteristics were similar between AF and control patients. Propranolol, verapamil, and procainamide suppressed ectopic beats that originated from the PVs. Of 116 ectopic foci that initiated AF, 103 (88.8%) originated from PVs. A mean of 7+/-3 RF applications completely eliminated 110 ectopic foci (94.8%). During the 6+/-2-month follow-up period, 68 patients (86. 1%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs. Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed 42.4% of ablated PVs had focal stenosis. One patient had mild exertional dyspnea after ablation, but it resolved 3 months later; 1 patient had onset of mild exertional dyspnea 5 months after ablation.\\ Electrophysiological characteristics of PVs are different from those in the atria. Ectopic beats from PVs can initiate AF, and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, calcium channel blockers, and sodium channel blockers can suppress these ectopic beats. Careful mapping and elimination of these ectopic foci can cure paroxysmal AF.},

Rates of depression in the different drugs and rate ratios (95% CI) were computed.\\ The crude overall rates of depression during treatment were 1.89, 1.92 and 1.62 per 1000 patient months for the ACE inhibitors, diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively. Using the ACE inhibitors as the reference group, the rate ratios for depression were 1.07 (0. 82-1.40) and 0.86 (0.69-1.08) for diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively.\\ This study does not support the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers are associated with depression, when considering patients treated in general practice in the UK.},

   Abstract={The combination of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers is more effective for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris than beta blocker monotherapy. Since ischemia in exercise-induced angina is essentially preceded by an increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic property may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic compounds. A 335-patient, 10-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5 and 10 mg, diltiazem XR 200 and 300 mg, and mibefradil 50 and 100 mg treatment added to baseline beta blocker treatment was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry. Although none of the calcium channel blockers improved duration of exercise or amount of workload, all of them significantly delayed onset of 1 mm ST segment depression on ETT (p<0.001 for any treatment versus baseline). In addition, mibefradil, both low- and high-dose treatment, produced the largest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 s, p<0.003 and <0.001, respectively; high dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, p<0.001 and <0.001, respectively). These effects were linearly correlated to the amount of rate pressure product (RPP) reduction. Serious symptoms of dizziness likewise occurred significantly more frequently with mibefradil (p<0.05) and led 19 patients taking mibefradil to withdraw from the trial. The authors conclude that calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic property provide better delay of ischemia in patients with exercise-induced angina but that the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness largely reduces this benefit.},

   Abstract={Recent studies have highlighted the potentially harmful effects of short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially of the dihydropyridine type, in patients with coronary heart disease. Some have argued that long-acting calcium channel blockers are safer, but few outcome data exist. The objective of the study was to compare the occurrence of adverse outcomes among recipients of long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers, with dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines compared separately.\\ The New Jersey Medicare population.\\ A retrospective cohort study using linked Medicare and drug claims data.\\ Older survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in 1989 and 1990. Eligible subjects had survived at least 30 days after the MI, participated in Medicare and a drug benefits program, and were prescribed a single type of either a long-acting or a short-acting calcium channel blocker within 90 days after the MI.\\ The two outcome measures were rates of all-cause mortality and cardiac rehospitalization. Using separate Cox regression models for dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine) and non-dihydropyridines (diltiazem, verapamil), we examined these outcomes for recipients of long-acting compared with short-acting calcium channel blockers.\\ Of the 833 patients eligible for the study, 160 were prescribed long-acting and 673 short-acting calcium channel blockers. Clinical characteristics of long-acting and short-acting users were comparable. During 2 years of follow-up, 221 deaths and 300 rehospitalizations occurred. Controlling for age, sex, race, and indicators of disease severity and comorbidity, the relative risk of dying for recipients of long-acting, compared with short-acting, dihydropyridines was .42 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.86). For cardiac rehospitalization, the relative risk was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.94). For the long-acting versus short-acting nondihydropyridines, the adjusted relative risk of dying was 1.43 (95% CI, 0.88-2.32), and for cardiac rehospitalization, .65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.05).\\ Use of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers after acute MI was associated with substantially lower rates of cardiac rehospitalization and death compared with use of their short-acting counterparts. More data are needed to address the possibility that long-acting, compared with short-acting, non-dihydropyridines could decrease rehospitalization rates but increase mortality.},

   Abstract={The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial was to compare the antianginal and antiischemic efficacy of a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg once daily with both drugs given separately once daily in patients with stable effort-induced angina pectoris. The secondary objective was to compare the tolerability of the 3 treatments.\\ The main criteria for inclusion were stable effort-induced angina pectoris for at least 2 months before the enrollment and a positive bicycle exercise test result. Patients were allocated to once-daily treatment with either felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg, felodipine 10 mg, or metoprolol 100 mg. The duration of active double-blind treatment was 4 weeks. There were 3 primary efficacy variables in the study; time until end of exercise, time until onset of chest discomfort, and time until 1-mm ST depression during a standardized exercise test.\\ The number of patients randomized was 397. There was a statistically significant improvement in time until end of exercise with felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg compared with metoprolol 100 mg (P =.04) and felodipine 10 mg compared with metoprolol 100 mg ( P =.03). However, for time until onset of pain or time until 1-mm ST-depression there were no significant differences among the treatment groups. At highest comparable workload, ST depression was less pronounced with felodipine-metoprolol than with metoprolol alone (P =.04), and the rate-pressure product was significantly lower in the groups receiving felodipine-metoprolol and metoprolol than in the group receiving felodipine alone. The combination and metoprolol were better tolerated than felodipine alone.\\ In stable angina pectoris, the combination felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg and felodipine 10 mg alone increased exercise time compared with metoprolol 100 mg. The combination tablet and metoprolol 100 mg alone showed a more favorable tolerability profile than felodipine 10 mg alone.},

   Abstract={To examine whether the degree of stress associated with adverse physical side effects correlates with overall quality of life (QOL) and compliance rates. To determine if instruments used to assess QOL can detect differences between treatments that have no known central nervous system effects.\\ This randomized, double-blind, parallel group study evaluated 180 to 480 mg of controlled onset, extended release (COER)-verapamil (n = 259) or 30 to 120 mg/d of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) (n = 269) in men and women between 21 and 80 years of age with stages 1 to 3 hypertension. A battery of questions evaluating psychological well-being and a physical symptom distress index was administered after a 4-week placebo washout (baseline) and after 10 weeks of treatment or at dropout.\\ Both treatments effectively lowered blood pressure, and there were no significant between-group differences in psychosocial QOL. A difference in the level of physical symptom distress was detected between treatments (P = .002; multivariate analysis of variance), with 7 significant univariate treatment effects, all favoring COER-verapamil, being noted-pedal edema, polyuria, rapid heart beat or palpitations, hives, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and headaches. Constipation-related distress increased significantly (P = .001) but to a similar extent with both treatments. The difference in symptom distress tended to predict compliance as there were more withdrawals in the nifedipine GITS group (n = 85) vs COER-verapamil group (n = 64) (P = .08).\\ Patient-assessed physical symptom distress is a sensitive, simple technique to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive medications on QOL and tolerability, as shown by its ability to detect the improvement associated with COER-verapamil. Depending on the agents involved, the Physical Symptom Distress Index may more closely predict dropout rates than the traditional psychosocial instruments, as suggested by the lower dropout rate in the COER-verapamil group. Thus, in studying treatment effects on QOL, both the distress of physical symptoms and the impact of psychosocial factors should be evaluated.},

A markedly higher prevalence was observed in women compared with men for: pain in the joints of the hands (35% of women complained of this against 22% of men); 'racing heart' (33% against 17%); dry eyes (16% against 6%); blurring of vision (35% against 23%); cramps in the legs (43% against 31%); and a sore throat (15% against 7%). Nocturia was the most frequent complaint (68% in both sexes). Eight symptoms increased with age and one (rash) tended to decline. With increasing systolic pressure women also reported more headaches, unsteadiness, blurring of vision, irregular heart beat and 'racing heart' but, of these, only headaches increased with diastolic pressure. These observations were made after adjusting for age, blood sugar and body mass index (BMI) and were not observed in men. Higher blood sugars were associated with mouth ulcers, 'racing heart', blurring of vision and cramps in the legs. A higher BMI was associated with six symptoms, and a lower age of leaving education with eight. In men, alcohol consumption was related to 'racing heart', and smoking to wheezing and having a dry cough.\\ A high level of complaint was associated with female gender, increasing age, blood sugar and BMI and a low age of leaving education.},

   Abstract={The Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial proved that blood pressure (BP) lowering therapy starting with nitrendipine reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications in older (> or = 60 years) patients with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP > or = 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 95 mm Hg). After the completion of the Syst-Eur trial on 14 February 1997, 3506 consenting patients (93.0% of those eligible) were enrolled in phase 2 of the Syst-Eur trial. This open follow-up study aims to confirm the safety of long-term antihypertensive therapy based on a dihydropyridine. To lower the sitting systolic BP below 150 mm Hg (target BP), the first-line agent nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) may be associated with enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), both add-on study drugs, or if required any other antihypertensive agent. On 1 November 1998, 3248 patients were still being followed, 86 patients had proceeded to non-supervised follow-up, and 43 had died. The median follow-up in Syst-Eur 2 was 14.3 months. At the last available visit, systolic/diastolic BP in the patients formerly randomised to placebo (n = 1682) or active treatment (n = 1824), had decreased by 13.2/5.2 mm Hg and by 4.6/1.6 mm Hg, respectively, so that the between-group BP difference was 1.7 mm Hg systolic (95% Ci: 0.8 to 2.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and 0.9 mm Hg diastolic (95% Cl: 0.4 to 1.5 mm mm Hg; P < 0.001). At the beginning of Syst-Eur 2, the goal BP was reached by 25.4% and 50.6% of the former placebo and active-treatment groups; at the last visit these proportions were 55.9% and 63.1%, respectively. At that moment, 45.9% of the patients were on monotherapy with nitrendipine, 29.3% took nitrendipine in combination with other study drugs. Until the end of 2001, BP control of the Syst-Eur 2 patients will be further improved. Cardiovascular complications and adverse events, such as cancer or gastro-intestinal bleeding, will be monitored and validated by blinded experts.},

   Abstract={It has been proposed that worsening of heart failure with dihydropyridines, such as nicardipine, is related to the activation of the neuroendocrine system. To test this, we evaluated 20 patients with severe heart failure (mean age, 55 +/- 13 years; New York Heart Association functional class III; left ventricular ejection fraction, 18% +/- 8% on maintenance therapy with captopril, digoxin, and diuretics) who were randomized to nicardipine (60 or 90 mg/d) or placebo during a 4-month double-blind protocol. The following measurements were obtained at baseline, monthly, and at 4 months or last follow-up visit: rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography, maximal treadmill time, 6-minute walking test distance, serum norepinephrine and aldosterone concentrations, and plasma renin activity. During the follow-up period, worsening of heart failure occurred in 6 patients in the nicardipine group and in 2 patients in the placebo group (p = 0.06). The maximal treadmill time for a 6-minute walking distance and exercise radionuclide ejection fraction at the last follow-up visit did not change in patients who did not deteriorate with heart failure in the placebo or nicardipine groups as compared with baseline values. In this study group of patients with severe heart failure receiving therapy with digoxin, captopril, and diuretics, nicardipine was associated with worsening heart failure without an apparent activation of the neurohormones. However, because of the small number of patients and a significant number of patients who deteriorated during the follow-up period, no definitive conclusions can be made.},

A total of 551 patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia and evidence of coronary artery disease were randomized to a 4-week, forced-dose titration treatment period with (1) COER-24 verapamil 240 mg titrated to 480 mg at bedtime (n = 173), (2) amlodipine 5 mg titrated to 10 mg/day (n = 149), (3) amlodipine 5 mg (titrated to 10 mg) plus atenolol 50 mg/day in the A.M. (n = 154), or (4) placebo (n = 75). Treadmill exercise tolerance testing (standard Bruce protocol), and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring were performed at the end of placebo lead-in and double-blind treatment. Each active treatment significantly improved symptom-limited exercise duration and time to moderate angina (p < or = 0.01 vs placebo). For patients with baseline ischemia, amlodipine resulted in a statistically significant increase in total duration of ischemic episodes compared with placebo, whereas COER-24 verapamil and amlodipine plus atenolol resulted in statistically significant decreases compared with placebo and amlodipine. Heart rate at onset of ischemic episodes and ST product were also significantly increased with amlodipine (p < 0.05) compared with either COER-24 or amlodipine plus atenolol. COER-24 and amlodipine alone or in combination with atenolol improved exercise capacity in patients with angina pectoris. COER-24 verapamil monotherapy or amlodipine plus atenolol combination therapy were more effective than amlodipine monotherapy in decreasing ambulatory myocardial ischemia, especially during the hours of 6 A.M. to 12 noon.},

   Abstract={The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by chronic medication with calcium channel blockers is uncertain. Although there have been several studies examining this question, the results are conflicting, with previous estimates ranging from 20% to 83%. There have been only 2 studies examining the prevalence of overgrowth induced by diltiazem and amlodipine, with estimates of 74% and 3.3%, respectively.\\ The current study aimed to address the problems associated with these studies by examining a sample of patients taking one of 3 calcium channel blockers, who were drawn from a community-based population in northeastern England. Nine hundred eleven (911) subjects were recruited from general medical practices in the area. Of these, 442 were taking nifedipine, 181 amlodipine, and 186 diltiazem. In addition, 102 control subjects were examined. Drug and demographic data for each subject were recorded. The periodontal condition of all subjects was assessed including plaque index, papillary bleeding index, and a photograph of the anterior gingivae for subsequent analysis of overgrowth severity.\\ More than six percent (6.3%) of subjects taking nifedipine were seen to have significant overgrowth. This overgrowth was statistically greater than the amount of overgrowth seen in either of the other 2 drug groups or the control population. The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by amlodipine or diltiazem was not statistically significant when compared to the control group. The severity of overgrowth within the nifedipine group was found to be related to the amount of gingival inflammation and also to the gender of the subject, with males being 3 times as likely to develop overgrowth than females.\\ The prevalence of clinically significant overgrowth related to chronic medication with calcium channel blockers is low, i.e., 6.3% for nifedipine. Males are 3 times as likely as females to develop clinically significant overgrowth. The presence of gingival inflammation is an important cofactor for the expression of this effect.},

   Abstract={We compared the effects of five pharmacologic regimens on the circadian rhythm and exercise-induced changes of ventricular rate (VR) in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF).\\ Systematic comparison of standardized drug regimens on 24 h VR control in CAF have not been reported.\\ In 12 patients (11 male, 69+/-6 yr) with CAF, the effects on VR by 5 standardized daily regimens: 1) 0.25 mg digoxin, 2) 240 mg diltiazem-CD, 3) 50 mg atenolol, 4) 0.25 mg digoxin + 240 mg diltiazem-CD, and 5) 0.25 mg digoxin + 50 mg atenolol; were studied after 2 week treatment assigned in random order. The VR data were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures. The circadian phase differences were evaluated by cosinor analysis.\\ The 24-h mean (+/-SD) values of VR (bpm) were - digoxin: 78.9 +/- 16.3, diltiazem: 80.0+/-15.5, atenolol: 75.9+/-11.7, digoxin + diltiazem: 67.3+/-14.1 and digoxin + atenolol: 65.0+/-9.4. Circadian patterns were significant in each treatment group (p < 0.001). The VR on digoxin + atenolol was significantly lower than that on digoxin (p < 0.0001), diltiazem (p < 0.0002) and atenolol (p < 0.001). The time of peak VR on Holter was significantly delayed with regimens 3 and 5 which included atenolol (p < 0.03). During exercise, digoxin and digoxin + atenolol treatments resulted in the highest and lowest mean VR respectively. The exercise Time-VR plots of all groups were nearly parallel (p = ns). The exercise duration was similar in all treatment groups (p = ns).\\ This study indicates that digoxin and diltiazem, as single agents at the doses tested, are least effective for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation during daily activity. Digoxin + atenolol produced the most effective rate control reflecting a synergistic effect on the AV node. The data provides a basis for testing the effects of chronic suppression of diurnal fluctuations of VR on left atrial and ventricular function in CAF.},

   Abstract={-Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with stable angina receiving nifedipine as monotherapy or combination therapy and in active drug controls. A MEDLARS search of published articles from 1966 to 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies, identified 60 randomized controlled trials that met protocol criteria. Blinded articles were extracted by 2 physicians. The pooled risks of death, withdrawal, and cardiovascular event were computed and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) for all nifedipine formulations and relative to same study control drug regimens. Thirty cardiovascular events were reported in 2635 nifedipine exposures (1.14%) and 19 events in 2655 other active drug exposures (0.72%). Unadjusted ORs for nifedipine versus controls were 1.40 (95% CI, 0.56 to 3.49) for major events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.67) for increased angina, and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.87) for all events (major events plus increased angina). Episodes of increased angina were more frequent on immediate-release nifedipine (OR, 4.19 [95% CI, 1.41 to 12.49]) and on nifedipine monotherapy (OR, 2.61 [95% CI, 1.30 to 5.26]). The OR for immediate-release nifedipine was significantly higher than that for sustained-release/extended-release nifedipine (P=0.001), and the OR for nifedipine monotherapy was higher than that for nifedipine combination therapy (P=0.03). Increased risks of cardiovascular events in patients with stable angina on nifedipine were due primarily to more episodes of increased angina, confined to the immediate-release formulation and to nifedipine monotherapy.},

   Abstract={Thirteen psoriatic patients with hypertension during the course of cyclosporin A therapy were treated for 25 months with a calcium channel blocker, sustained-release nifedipine, to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and adverse events during treatment with both drugs. Seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin A therapy. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy, and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months. The adverse events during combined therapy with cyclosporin A and nifedipine included an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patients. Our findings indicate that sustained-release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long-term treatment with cyclosporin A, but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia.},

   Abstract={A recent study suggested that the risk of all cancers, including prostate cancer, is increased by the use of calcium channel blockers. The objective of this study was to determine whether prostate cancer is associated with calcium channel blocker use. A case-control study was conducted in Massachusetts using cases diagnosed from December 1992 through February 1995. Cases were men identified by tumor registrars who were less than 70 years old with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Controls were men with no history of prostate cancer or symptoms of undiagnosed prostate cancer, and were matched to the cases on precinct of residence and half-decade of age. A total of 1217 cases of prostate cancer and 1400 community controls are included in this analysis. Data were collected by telephone interview. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks for calcium channel blockers use while controlling for confounding. The relative risk for prostate cancer for any use of calcium channel blockers relative to nonuse was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.5). There was no evidence of a trend according to duration of use. When the analysis was confined to symptomatic men, the relative risk estimate was 1.1 (0.8-1.4) overall and 1.2 (0.8-1.7) among those aged 65 to 69 years. Relative risk estimates for the use of other classes of antihypertensive drugs among symptomatic men were close to 1.0; the corresponding estimates among asymptomatic men were generally further from 1.0. These findings suggest that calcium channel blockers do not increase the risk of prostate cancer. The differences in the relative risk estimates between symptomatic and asymptomatic men are compatible with detection bias. Because of the widespread use of Prostate-Specific Antigen testing for early detection of prostate cancer, potential detection bias needs to be considered in future studies of prostate cancer.},

   Abstract={Compliance with hypertension treatment is affected by treatment-related factors (complexity, side effects), efficacy and compound-specific effects that impact on quality of life. This study examined the differences in quality of life produced by two once-daily calcium channel blockers using different delivery systems: nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and amlodipine.\\ This was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial comparing nifedipine GITS (30 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg) for 24 weeks following a placebo run-in. Clinical, laboratory evaluations and quality-of-life data were assessed at screening, baseline randomization and three times during active therapy.\\ The study was conducted in 13 medical clinics in Spain.\\ The sample comprised 430 screened and 356 randomized patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg).\\ Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in health-related quality of life were the main outcome measures.\\ There were no significant differences between active treatment groups in the blood pressure changes (systolic blood pressure: nifedipine GITS -15.5 mmHg; amlodipine -15.7 mmHg). Spontaneous adverse events consistent with calcium channel blockage were not different. The nifedipine GITS group improved in all quality-of-life measures except Sexual Symptom Distress and showed a significantly greater improvement than amlodipine in overall Quality of Life (P< 0.05), General Perceived Health (P < 0.026) and its subscale Vitality (P < 0.019). The amlodipine group declined in overall Quality of Life, General Perceived Health, Vitality and Sleep Disturbance, and significantly in Sexual Symptom Distress (P < 0.045). However, this group improved in self-reported Cognitive Functioning (P=0.036), Mental Acuity (P < 0.005) and Detachment/disorientation (P=0.01).\\ These results suggest compound-specific effects on quality of life that may be due to differences in the delivery system. Nifedipine GITS is short-acting (2 h half-life) and is delivered continuously over a 24 h period, while amlodipine has a half-life of 40 h, which may produce more sustained low-level effects. While a more beneficial profile was observed for nifedipine, amlodipine demonstrated potential positive effects on cognitive functioning.},

   Abstract={It is unclear whether the carotid intima-media thickness can be influenced by antihypertensive treatment and whether some antihypertensive agents, such as calcium antagonists, may have a greater effect on this parameter than others, such as diuretics. The present paper reports the principal results of the ultrasound substudy of the randomized, prospective, controlled, Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS).\\ In 498 hypertensive patients in eight Italian centres, randomized to either verapamil (240 mg once a day) or chlorthalidone (25 mg once a day), a B-mode ultrasound scan was performed according to a standardized procedure at baseline and after 3, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months of treatment. The maximum intima-media thicknesses of the far walls of common, bifurcation and internal carotid arteries were measured bilaterally, and the following indices calculated: the mean thickness at the six measured sites, the mean thickness at the common and bifurcation sites and the single maximum thickness. The primary endpoint for treatment efficacy was the slope of the change over 4 years (rate of change, mm/year), corrected by using the initial mean over the six sites (baseline + 3 months) as a covariate (mm/year per mm). The patients were also classified into three strata according to their baseline single maximum thickness: those with normal carotid arteries (single maximum ( 1 mm), those with thickened carotid arteries (single maximum > 1 and < or = 1.5 mm and those with carotid plaques (single maximum > 1.5 mm).\\ Among the 456 patients with satisfactory baseline ultrasound readings, 33% were classified with normal carotid arteries, 27% with thickened carotid arteries and 40% with plaques. In the intention-to-treat population (377 patients with ultrasound measurements taken on at least three different occasions over a period of at least 2 years), the rate of change in the mean thickness at the six sites measured was rather small (0.015 mm/year), but significantly (P < 0.05) smaller in patients with plaques (0.003 mm/year) than in patients with thickened or with normal carotids (0.023 and 0.025 mm/year, respectively). When related to initial values, the rate of change in the mean thickness at the six sites had a negative slope (-0.059 mm/year per mm, P < 0.01). Although rates of change in the carotid intima-media thickness in unstratified patients were not different in those treated with verapamil or with chlorthalidone, when changes in the mean thickness of six sites were related to the initial value, the slope of this relationship was significantly different in the two treatment groups (verapamil -0.082 versus chlorthalidone -0.037 mm/year per mm, P < 0.02). The blood pressure-lowering effect of the two randomized treatments was similar. Taking fatal and nonfatal, major and minor cardiovascular events together, there were 19 events in the verapamil group and 35 in the chlorthalidone group, with a significantly (P < 0.01) greater incidence in patients with plaques, and among patients with plaques in those who were randomized to chlorthalidone (P < 0.05).\\ In accord with evidence from animal models of atherosclerosis, the calcium antagonist verapamil was more effective than the diuretic chlorthalidone in promoting regression of thicker carotid lesions. Changes in the carotid intima-media thickness were small in both groups, and the differences between the changes under the two treatments were consequently small, but the observation that these small differences in carotid wall changes were paralleled by differences in the incidence of cardiovascular events (better intima-media thickness regression with verapamil paralleled by a lower cardiovascular event rate) suggests that even small effects on carotid plaques may have clinical and prognostic relevance.},

   Abstract={The management of permanent atrial fibrillation (PAF) consists primarily of long-term anticoagulation with either aspirin or warfarin to prevent systemic embolization, and modulation of ventricular rate (VR) to improve cardiac function by prolonging the ventricular diastolic filling time.\\ The effects of slow-release formulations of gallopamil (100 mg b.i.d.), diltiazem (120 mg b.i.d.), or verapamil (120 mg b.i.d.) on VR were evaluated in 18 patients with PAF without organic heart disease.\\ In all patients, each treatment was administered randomly, was compared with oral digoxin, and was assessed by 24-h Holter monitoring during daily life and by a 6-min walking test.\\ There were no significant differences in mean and minimum VR recorded during 24-h Holter monitoring among the four treatments. Peak heart rates recorded during the 6-min walking test with digoxin treatment was 167 +/- 12 beats/min. This was significantly reduced by gallopamil (149 +/- 23 beats/min, p = 0.01), diltiazem (142 +/- 24 beats/min, p < 0.001), and verapamil (137 +/- 30 beats/min, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in peak VR during the walking test among the three calcium antagonists. Pauses of > 3 s were observed in 3 of 18 (17%) patients who received digoxin (max 3.4 s) and in 5 of 18 (28%) patients who received diltiazem (max 3.4 s); p = NS. Periods of bradycardia < 30 beats/min were observed in 5 of 18 (28%) patients during digoxin treatment, and in 3 of 18 (17%) patients during treatment with gallopamil, diltiazem, and verapamil; p = NS.\\ Gallopamil, diltiazem, or verapamil are superior to digoxin in controlling VR during mild exercise in patients with PAF without organic heart disease. The reduction of peak VR is obtainable without further slowing of resting VR. However, gallopamil appears to be the least effective calcium blocker at controlling resting and exercise VR; thus, there are no advantages over the other calcium blockers in its use in the clinical setting.},

   Abstract={The primary objective of the International Verapamil SR/Trandolapril Study (INVEST) is to compare the risk for adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or nonfatal stroke) in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with either a calcium antagonist-based or a noncalcium antagonist-based strategy.\\ Treatment recommendations for hypertension include initial therapy with a diuretic or beta-adrenergic blocking agent, for which reductions in morbidity and mortality are documented from randomized trials but are less than expected from epidemiologic data. For this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents reduce blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodologic limitations and did not differentiate among calcium antagonist types and formulations. Several studies differentiating among calcium antagonist types and an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil and suggestion for benefit in CAD patients.\\ A total of 27,000 CAD patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care sites to receive either a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic "paper-less" system for direct on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail pharmacy linked to the coordination center via the Internet.\\ Contract negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. Patients being enrolled are predominantly elderly (72% aged 60 years or older) men (54%), with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or prior MI (71%). In addition to hypertension, CAD and elderly age, most patients (89%) have one or more associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) contributing to increased risk for adverse outcome. While 26% have diabetes, most of these are noninsulin dependent. Using the protocol strategies, target blood pressures (according to JNC VI) have been reached in 58% at the fourth visit, and as expected most (89%) are requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs.\\ The design and baseline characteristics of the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in CAD patients are described.},

A possible association of the use of calcium channel blockers with cancer incidence and cancer mortality was addressed using data from the Nurses' Health Study.\\ In this study, a total of 18,635 female nurses reported regularly taking at least 1 of 4 cardiovascular medications in 1988: diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Cancer incidence and cancer deaths were ascertained until 1994.\\ During 6 years of follow-up, 852 women were newly diagnosed with cancer and 335 women died of cancer. Women who reported the use of calcium channel blockers had no increased risk of newly diagnosed cancer compared with those taking other cardiovascular drugs (relative risk=1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.26). The relative risk of dying from cancer associated with the self-reported use of calcium channel blockers was 1.25 (95% CI 0.91-1.72). Relative risks were adjusted for the following self-reported factors: age; weight; height; cholesterol level; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; smoking; alcohol intake; physical activity; menopausal status; postmenopausal hormone use; aspirin use; and history of diabetes, cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, angina, and hypertension. Regarding site specific cancer incidence and mortality, only lung cancer incidence was somewhat increased (RR=1.61; 95% CI 0.88-2.96).\\ These data suggest no important increase in overall cancer incidence or cancer mortality related to the self-reported use of calcium channel blockers.},

Fifty-nine (3%) patients had a MMSE score of 23 or less. The MMSE score decreased with advancing age (r = -0.21, P < 0.001).

   Abstract={Investigations of calcium antagonists in patients with advanced heart failure have raised concern over an increased risk of worsening heart failure and heart failure deaths. We assessed the effect of amlodipine on cause-specific mortality in such patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In total, 1,153 patients in New York Heart Association class IIIb or IV heart failure were randomized to receive amlodipine or placebo, along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Over a median 14.5 months of follow-up, 413 patients died. Cardiovascular deaths accounted for 89% of fatalities, 50% of which were sudden deaths and 45% of which were due to pump failure, with fewer attributed to myocardial infarction (3.3%) or other cardiovascular causes (1.6%). Amlodipine treatment resulted in a greater relative reduction in sudden deaths (21%) than in pump failure deaths (6.6%) overall. When patients were classified by etiology of heart failure (ischemic or nonischemic), cause-specific mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups in the ischemic stratum. In the nonischemic stratum, however, sudden deaths and pump failure deaths were reduced by 38% and 45%, respectively, with amlodipine. Thus, when added to digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with advanced heart failure, amlodipine appears to have no effect on cause-specific mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy, but both pump failure and sudden deaths appear to be decreased in nonischemic heart failure patients treated with amlodipine.},

   Abstract={In animal and in vitro studies, several calcium antagonists have been shown to block apoptosis (programmed cell death), a natural cellular defence against cancer. On the basis of these studies, it has been hypothesised that calcium antagonists may function as cancer promoters and that they might cause cancer in humans. The association between the use of calcium antagonists and cancer has been addressed recently in 6 independent epidemiological studies. Four of these studies--2 cohort and 2 case-control--found a significantly higher risk of cancer among users of certain calcium antagonists as compared with either non-users or with users of other antihypertensive agents. The other 2 studies failed to find support for this association. All studies had limitations of varying types and significance. The emerging pattern from these investigations includes the following features: (i) the strength of the association appears to be dependent on daily dosage, ranging from no association in users of low dosages to a 2-fold (or possibly higher) increased risk in users of higher dosages; (ii) the time lag to the appearance of this association appears to be at least 2 to 3 years; (iii) an association with a higher risk of cancer has been found primarily for verapamil, while no such relationship has been reported for diltiazem; and (iv) no highly consistent associations have been shown with specific cancer sites or histological types. More data, preferably from long-term randomised clinical trials, are required before firm conclusions can be drawn.},

   Abstract={Myocardial stunning may cause prolonged left ventricular dysfunction after exercise-induced ischemia that can be attenuated by calcium antagonists in animal models. To assess their effects in humans, we performed a randomized, double-blind crossover study comparing the calcium antagonist amlodipine (10 mg once daily) versus isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, 50 mg once daily) on postexercise stunning.\\ Twenty-four men with chronic stable angina and normal left ventricular function underwent serial quantitative exercise stress echocardiography after 3 weeks on each treatment to assess the degree of postexercise stunning with simultaneous sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion scans at peak stress to quantify the ischemic burden. Exercise time (P=1), maximum ST depression (P=0.48), and sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography scores (P=0.17) were unchanged between treatments. Stunning occurred more often with ISMN than amlodipine (82% versus 48%). The global and segmental stress echocardiography parameters of stunning were attenuated in patients while taking amlodipine compared with ISMN. Shortening fractions and ejection fractions were less impaired 30 minutes after exercise in patients receiving amlodipine (3.5+/-1.4% versus 2.5+/-1.4%, P=0.014, and 59.7+/-5.4% versus 54.5+/-8%, P<0.001); similarly, the isovolumic relaxation period was less prolonged with amlodipine (93+/-15.5 versus 106.3+/-14.9 ms, P=0.018).\\ Despite comparable levels of ischemia, amlodipine attenuated stunning when compared with ISMN. This beneficial effect may relate to a prevention of the calcium overload implicated in the pathogenesis of stunning.},

   Abstract={We compared the effects of cilnidipine and nifedipine retard on 24-h blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and autonomic nerve activity in patients with essential hypertension. Cilnidipine is a novel and unique 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that has the L-type and N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel-blocking action. Fourteen hypertensive outpatients (four men and 10 women; aged 64 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SEM) were enrolled in this study. Their ambulatory BP and electrocardiogram were monitored for 24 h at intervals of 30 min with a portable recorder after a 4-week drug-free period, after a 4-week treatment period with cilnidipine (5 or 10 mg once daily), and after a 4-week treatment period with nifedipine retard (10 or 20 mg twice daily). The order of the three periods was randomized. Autonomic nerve activity was evaluated by a power spectral analysis of HR variability, by using the high-frequency (HF) component as an index of parasympathetic nerve activity and the ratio of the low-frequency (LF) component to the HF component (LF/HF) as an index of sympathovagal balance. Cilnidipine and nifedipine retard significantly reduced the 24-h BP of these patients to similar extents (cilnidipine, -11 +/- 3/-6 +/- 1 mm Hg; nifedipine retard, -15 +/- 3/-6 +/- 2 mm Hg). Cilnidipine did not change the 24-h average HR, whereas nifedipine retard significantly increased it (+3.3 +/- 1.4 beats/min; p < 0.05). Nifedipine retard significantly increased the LF/HF ratio in the daytime and the nighttime. Such changes were limited to the daytime in the treatment period with cilnidipine. These results suggest that cilnidipine is effective as a once-daily antihypertensive agent and had less influence on autonomic nervous system and HR than did nifedipine retard.},

   Abstract={The Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, two-arm, actively controlled, multicenter, international 5-year clinical trial involving 15,000 patients. CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil, which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm. An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and 190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.},

   Abstract={Perioperative administration of intravenous diltiazem to patients undergoing cardiac procedures has been shown to decrease the incidence of ischemia and arrhythmias. However, after adopting this practice in our cardiac surgery program, we perceived an increased incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction.\\ A directed record review of postoperative renal function was conducted for consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operation for the time periods before and after adoption of prophylactic intravenous diltiazem (0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 24 hours). The two groups were compared using chi 2 and two-sample t tests. The risk of development of postoperative renal failure was modeled with logistic regression.\\ Diltiazem-treated patients (n = 271) were similar to the control patients (n = 143) in terms of age (64 versus 61 years; p = 0.14), ejection fraction (0.46 versus 0.47; p = 0.61), baseline serum creatinine level (1.2 versus 1.1 mg/dL; p = 0.27), prevalence of comorbid conditions, and surgical characteristics. The prevalence of left main coronary artery disease was lower in the diltiazem group than the control group (39% versus 52%; p = 0.01). During the 7-day postoperative period, the average peak serum creatinine level was higher in the diltiazem group (1.7 +/- 0.9 mg/dL; mean +/- 1 standard deviation) than the control group (1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dL; p = 0.003). The incidence of acute renal failure requiring dialysis was 4.4% in the diltiazem group versus 0.7% in the control group (p = 0.04). There was no difference in length of hospitalization or mortality. The risk of acute renal failure was strongly associated with intravenous diltiazem (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 6.3; p = 0.08), age (AOR 2.5 per 10 years; p = 0.07), baseline serum creatinine (AOR 4.8 per 1 mg/dL; p = 0.02), the presence of left main coronary disease (AOR 5.3; p = 0.02), and the presence of cerebrovascular disease (AOR 4.5; p = 0.05).\\ Our retrospective analysis suggests that prophylactic use of intravenous diltiazem in patients undergoing cardiac operations was associated with increased renal dysfunction. Further studies of the risk and benefits of intravenous diltiazem in this setting should be undertaken.},

   Abstract={The antianginal efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and diltiazem were compared in a double-blind randomized trial of 97 patients with angina resistant to atenolol alone. Both amlodipine and diltiazem significantly reduced the frequency of angina attacks (p <0.001) and glyceryl trinitrate consumption (p <0.05 to p <0.01). During Holter monitoring, both treatments reduced the overall frequency of ambulatory myocardial ischemia, although changes did not reach statistical significance. Exercise test parameters (total exercise time, time to angina, time to ST depression, and maximum ST depression) tended to improve with both treatments, but changes did not achieve statistical significance relative to baseline or to each other. Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients in the amlodipine group (30%) and in 17 patients in the diltiazem group (36%), but patients taking diltiazem reported almost twice as many adverse events (30) patients taking amlodipine (18). Quality of life, as assessed by total Nottingham Health Profile Scores, was not significantly different between treatments. The addition of either once-daily amlodipine or twice-daily sustained release diltiazem improved symptoms in patients with angina resistant to atenolol alone, but diltiazem was associated with more frequent and more serious adverse events.},

   Abstract={Anginal patients who remain symptomatic despite optimally dosed beta blockade may also be given dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. This treatment regimen was examined in a double-blind parallel, randomized, controlled study in 147 patients with angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta blockade with atenolol (heart rate at rest <60 beats/min). Patients were randomized to atenolol and/or placebo (control), and atenolol and/or amlodipine. The main outcome measurement was exercise tolerance after 8 weeks compared with baseline. After 8 weeks, no significant differences in time to 0.1-mV ST-segment depression, time to chest pain, and time to end of exercise were observed. The number of patients with chest pain during exercise decreased significantly in the amlodipine group (p = 0.04 vs controls). The subgroup of patients with an early (<6 minutes) onset of chest pain at baseline showed a significant increase in time to chest pain after amlodipine (p = 0.0001 vs controls). In the amlodipine group, ST depression and rate-pressure product at submaximum comparable workload decreased to 0.4 mm (0.56) (p = 0.03 vs controls) and 1.223 (2.652) beats/ min x mm Hg (p = 0.01 vs controls). The number of patients in each group with adverse events was not different. The addition of amlodipine to the treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia, despite optimal beta blockade, is well tolerated and may lead to improvement in symptomatic anginal patients, who have a rapid onset of exercise-induced ischemia.},

   Abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary bypass graft surgery may result in hypotension, heart failure symptoms, embolic complications, and prolongation in length of hospital stay (LOHS). The purpose of this study was to determine whether intravenous diltiazem is more effective than digoxin for ventricular rate control in AF after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A secondary end point was to determine whether ventricular rate control with diltiazem reduces postoperative LOHS compared with digoxin.\\ Patients with AF and ventricular rate > 100 beats/min within 7 days after coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous therapy with diltiazem (n = 20) or digoxin (n = 20). Efficacy was measured with ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter monitoring). Safety was assessed by clinical monitoring and electrocardiographic recording. LOHS was measured from the day of surgery. Data were analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle in all randomly assigned patients. In addition, a separate intention-to-treat analysis was performed excluding patients who spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. In the analysis of all randomly assigned patients, those who received diltiazem achieved ventricular rate control (> or = 20% decrease in pretreatment ventricular rate) in a mean of 10 +/- 20 (median 2) minutes compared with 352 +/- 312 (median 228) minutes for patients who received digoxin (p < 0.0001). At 2 hours, the proportion of patients who achieved rate control was significantly higher in patients treated with diltiazem (75% vs 35%, p = 0.03). Similarly, at 6 hours, the response rate associated with diltiazem was higher than that in the digoxin group (85% vs 45%, p = 0.02). However, response rates associated with diltiazem and digoxin at 12 and 24 hours were not significantly different. At 24 hours, conversion to sinus rhythm had occurred in 11 of 20 (55%) patients receiving diltiazem and 13 of 20 (65%) patients receiving digoxin (p = 0.75). Results of the analysis of only those patients who remained in AF were similar to those presented above. There was no difference between the diltiazem-treated and digoxin-treated groups in postoperative LOHS (8.6 +/- 2.2 vs 7.7 +/- 2.0 days, respectively, p = 0.43).\\ Ventricular rate control occurs more rapidly with intravenous diltiazem than digoxin in AF after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, 12- and 24-hour response rates and duration of postoperative hospital stay associated with the two drugs are similar.},

   Abstract={This analysis sought to estimate the risk ratio for cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality associated with the use of calcium channel blocking agents (CCBs) in a large group of patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD).\\ Recent publications contend that the use of short-acting CCBs may double the risk of cancer incidence and possibly increase mortality in hypertensive patients.\\ Cancer incidence data were obtained for 11,575 patients screened for the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study, one-half of whom were treated at the time of screening with CCBs, over a mean follow-up period of 2.8 years. Cause-specific mortality was available through September 1996 (mean follow-up 5.2 years). The statistical power of detecting an odds ratio > or = 1.5 (given the cancer incidence rate of 2.1 in the nonusers of CCBs) was 0.91. The power declined to 0.77, 0.54 and 0.41, with declining odds ratios of 1.4, 1.3 and 1.25, respectively.\\ Of 246 incident cancer cases, 129 occurred among the users (2.3%) and 117 among nonusers of CCBs (2.1%). After adjustment for age, gender and smoking, the odds ratio estimates for all cancers combined was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.37) for CCB users relative to nonusers. The adjusted risk ratio for all-cause mortality for age, gender and smoking and pertinent prognostic clinical characteristics was estimated at 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). The adjusted risk ratio for cancer-related mortality was 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.41).\\ Patients with CHD treated with CCBs exhibited a similar risk of cancer incidence and total and cancer-related mortality compared with nonusers of CCBs. This analysis provides a certain assurance that CCB use in middle-aged and elderly patients with CHD is not associated with a meaningful difference in cancer incidence and related mortality.},

   Year="1998",
   Volume="43",
   Pages="533--562",
   Abstract={During the past 20 years the number of subclasses of calcium channel blockers has increased from one to four. Three classes have only a single clinically approved compound: verapamil, diltiazem, and mibefradil. The fourth class, dihydropyridines, contains numerous compounds. All agents are effective in lowering blood pressure in short-term studies, and side effects that trouble the patient are infrequent. Long-term studies in hypertensive patients are limited. Short-acting agents such as nifedipine have been associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in some, but not all studies. These agents also probably create a compliance problem for hypertensive patients because of the need for multiple daily doses and their unpleasant side effects, e.g., ankle edema, palpitations, and flushing. Therefore, they are not useful or indicated for the treatment of hypertensive patients. No data have suggested that long-acting dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers share the same fate. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest the opposite: they have a cardioprotective effect. However, definitive information will require the completion of several long-term trials, including ALLHAT, CONVINCE, HOT, INSIGHT and NORDIL. Finally, it is important to reflect on the lessons learned from the controversy associated with the potential risks of calcium channel blockers. First, disagreements are common when one uses case-controlled studies and are reflective of the poor precision of the methods used. What is statistically relevant in one study may not hold true for another and may have no clinical relevance, particularly if the relative risk is less than 2. Investigators need to temper their enthusiasm to reflect this reality. Second, at the cutting edge of science there is probably relatively little agreement about what is correct among equally competent scientists. All have bias in their positions and should both recognize and admit so to themselves and their colleagues. Inferring that those who disagree have an unstated secondary agenda that will bring personal financial rewards or government accolades is inappropriate and counterproductive. Third, the randomized clinical trial, despite all its imperfections, is still the best tool to establish common ground on controversial issues. Finally, what may seem best from the public health perspective may not be in the best interest of the individual patient--a possibility that physicians have to constantly consider. For example, no public health benefit occurs if patients remain hypertensive because they fail to take their medications, no matter what the medication.},

   Abstract={It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study.\\ The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction) in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension.\\ Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients) throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8).\\ In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.},

   Abstract={The antianginal efficacy of 240 mg sustained release verapamil once daily doses and 300 mg diltiazem was studied in 20 normotensive patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, using a randomized, double-blind crossover design. Patients received a blinded therapy of verapamil placebo and diltiazem placebo for six weeks than only sustained-release diltiazem (SRD) for a long-term phase of three weeks, after a two-week placebo baseline period. Symptom-limited bicycle exercise was longer with the verapamil (510+/-129.9 s) and diltiazem (540+/-124.6 s) than with placebo at baseline (396+/-152.2 s, P<0.005). Verapamil and diltiazem reduced the weekly rate of anginal attacks from 5.1+/-8.6 during placebo to 4.4+/-4.1 with verapamil and 1.9+/-3.2 with diltiazem (P<0.05). The antianginal effects of the two agents are probably mediated by reduction of myocardial oxygen demand at submaximal exercise. In addition, diltiazem appears to provide more symptomatic relief and reduces the weekly number of anginal attacks significantly more than verapamil. Therefore its once-daily administration simplifies the treatment schedule and should improve patients' compliance.},

   Abstract={A meta-analysis was performed to compare the risk of serious adverse events associated with the use of all formulations of isradipine, when used as monotherapy in hypertension, to active drug or placebo controls. Eligible studies totalled 65 published and unpublished randomised controlled trials involving 9903 subjects and 10,675 treatment exposures: 4492 to isradipine, 1473 to isradipine sustained release, 2768 to other active drugs, and 1942 to placebo. Mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, other serious incident illnesses, such as cancer, and withdrawals were sought. Seventy-five per cent of the isradipine exposures were to standard-release formulations and 25% were to sustained-release formulations. Overall, isradipine therapy shows no difference in risk of major adverse events or withdrawals compared to other active controls or placebo (odds ratios [OR] 0.9; 95% CI 0.7-1.46 and 0.5; 95% CI 0.2-1.3). These major adverse events included angina, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and overall mortality. Isradipine sustained release could be compared only to placebo, based on available data, and shows a lower risk of withdrawals (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.9), and a similar trend was observed for major adverse events, (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.3-2.5). Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were analysed in separate meta-analyses and later combined when this sensitivity analysis of risk showed no differences between the groups. In conclusion, we find no evidence for increased risk of serious adverse events in patients receiving isradipine as monotherapy for hypertension.},

   Abstract={This multicenter, double-masked, randomized, forced-titration, parallel-group trial was designed to determine whether we could confirm the results of a previous trial that demonstrated a significantly greater antihypertensive effect for mibefradil compared with diltiazem CD. Two hundred thirty-nine patients with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and a baseline sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) between 95 and 114 mm Hg were randomized to receive once-daily treatment with mibefradil 50 mg (n = 119) or diltiazem CD 180 mg (n = 120). After 4 weeks of treatment, all patients underwent forced titration to mibefradil 100 mg or diltiazem CD 360 mg for an additional 8 weeks. After 12 weeks of active treatment, the mean reduction from baseline in trough SDBP was significantly greater with mibefradil than with diltiazem CD (-14.3 +/- 6.6 mm Hg vs -11.7 +/- 7.4 mm Hg, respectively). In addition, significantly more patients receiving mibefradil had a decrease in SDBP > or = 10 mm Hg or a decrease to < or = 90 mm Hg by week 12 than did patients receiving diltiazem CD (82% vs 72%, respectively). The tolerability of mibefradil and diltiazem CD were comparable, with similar percentages of patients in both groups reporting at least one adverse event (21% vs 22%, respectively) that was considered to be at least remotely related to the study drug. The results of this study confirm those of the previous trial. Once-daily treatment with mibefradil 100 mg is significantly more effective than diltiazem CD 360 mg in lowering both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Both drugs are well tolerated.},

   Abstract={The Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS) is a prospective randomized study the objective of which was to compare the long-term effects of verapamil and chlorthalidone on the blood pressure, clinical safety, and the progression/regression of carotid wall lesions in members of a large population of hypertensive patients.\\ After a 3-week placebo run-in period, 1414 hypertensive patients [692 men and 722 women, aged 53.2 +/- 7 years, blood pressure 168.9 +/- 10.5/ 102.2 +/- 5.0 mmHg (means +/- SD)] were assigned randomly to be administered either 240 mg sustained-release verapamil (n = 707) or 25 mg chlorthalidone (n = 707) once a day for 2 years. The study design was double blind for the first 6 months and open thereafter. 25-50 mg/day captopril were added to the treatment of non-responding patients; subsequently, patients not responding to combined therapy were switched to any therapy chosen by the treating doctors (free therapy). The blood pressure of the sitting subject, heart rate, and a standard clinical safety profile (electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, adverse events, cardiovascular events, and deaths) were assessed regularly throughout the study.\\ After 2 years the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly in members of both treatment groups (by 16.3/16.6% with verapamil and by 16.9/16.2% with chlorthalidone, both by analysis of variance, P < 0.0001). The patients for whom we added captopril treatment constituted 22.6% of the verapamil and 26.2% of the chlorthalidone group; while 11.6 and 12.2% of patients in these groups, respectively, were administered free therapy. Normalization of the diastolic blood pressure (to < or = 90 mmHg or to < or = 95 mmHg with a > or = 10% decrease) was achieved for 69.3% of the verapamil and 66.9% of the chlorthalidone group. A decrease in heart rate (by 5.8%) occurred in members of the verapamil group only. A decrease in total serum cholesterol (from 223.6 to 216.9 mg/dl, P < 0.01) and in the total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (from 4.9 to 4.5, P < 0.01) was noted for the verapamil group only, whereas significantly greater rates of hyperuricemia (plasma urate > 7.0 mg/dl; 10.8 versus 3.9%) and hypokalemia (serum K < 3.5 mmol/l; 24.6 versus 4.4%) were observed for the chlorthalidone group (P < 0.01, versus verapamil for both). Adverse events were reported by 32.5% of patients treated with verapamil and by 33.4% of those treated with chlorthalidone. The most frequent adverse events were constipation in members of the verapamil group (13.7%) and asthenia in members of the chlorthalidone group (8.5%). In total 315 dropped out (153 from the verapamil and 162 from the chlorthalidone group). The occurrence of cardiovascular events was similar for both treatments (42 events for verapamil and 43 for chlorthalidone, NS).\\ Similar antihypertensive efficacies, tolerabilities and cardiovascular event rates were observed with verapamil and with chlorthalidone. However, treatment with chlorthalidone was associated with significantly higher incidences of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia than was treatment with verapamil.},

The patients had angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta-blockade (resting heart rate < 65 beats.min-1). Randomization was to three treatment groups: continuation of metoprolol (control), addition of felodipine to metoprolol, and replacement of metoprolol by felodipine. Exercise tests were repeated after 2 and 5 weeks. The main outcome measure was: exercise result after 5 weeks, compared with baseline, between-group comparison of changes vs control. There were no significant differences in exercise duration and onset of chest pain vs control. The addition of felodipine increased time until 1 mm ST depression (43 s, 95% confidence interval 20-65 s), and decreased both ST depression at highest comparable work load (0.46 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.72), and maximal ST depression (0.49 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.74). Exercise results after replacement of metoprolol by felodipine were not different from control, apart from a significant increase in rate pressure product. Significantly more patients experienced adverse events in the felodipine monotherapy group.\\ Combination of metoprolol and felodipine is to be preferred to felodipine monotherapy in patients who have signs and symptoms of myocardial ischaemia despite optimal beta-blockade.},

   Abstract={Myocardial ischemia identified by ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG), exercising treadmill testing, (ETT), or 12-lead electrocardiogram at rest is associated with an adverse prognosis, but the effect of improving these ischemic manifestations by treatment on outcome is unknown. The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study was a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute funded study to determine the feasibility of conducting a large-scale prognosis study and to assess the effect of 3 treatment strategies (angina-guided strategy, AECG ischemia-guided strategy, and revascularization strategy) in reducing the manifestations of ischemia as indicated by AECG and ETT. The study cohort for this database study consisted of 496 randomized patients who performed the AECG, ETT, and 12-lead electrocardiogram at rest at both the qualifying and week 12 visits. The effect of modifying ischemia by treatment on the incidence of cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or hospitalization for an ischemic event) at 1 year was examined. In the 2 medical treatment groups (n = 328) there was an association between the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemic episodes at the qualifying visit and combined cardiac events at 1 year (p = 0.003). In the AECG ischemia-guided patients there was a trend associating greater reduction in the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemia episodes with a reduced incidence of combined cardiac events (r = -0.15, p = 0.06). In the revascularization strategy patients this association was absent. In the medical treatment patients the exercise duration on the baseline ETT was inversely associated with an adverse prognosis (p = 0.02). The medical treatment strategies only slightly improved the exercise time and the exercise duration remained of prognostic significance. In the revascularization group strategy patients this association was absent. Thus, myocardial ischemia detected by AECG and an abnormal ETT are each independently associated with an adverse cardiac outcome in patients subsequently treated medically.},

   Abstract={Mibefradil is a new benzimidazolyl-substituted tetraline-derivative calcium antagonist. Its vasodilatory activity combined with an ability to lower heart rate without negative inotropic effects as well as its long duration of action make it a promising anti-ischemic agent.\\ Three hundred nine patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris, and positive exercise tests were randomized to receive mibefradil (50, 100, or 150 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), or placebo. The anti-ischemic effects of mibefradil on exercise test and silent ischemia parameters were assessed. At doses of 100 and 150 mg, mibefradil increased exercise duration (by 55.5 and 51.0 seconds, respectively; P<.001 for both), increased time to onset of angina (by 98.3 and 82.7 seconds, respectively; P<.001), and increased time to 1-mm ST depression (by 81.7 and 94.3 seconds, respectively; P<.001). By comparison, a 10 mg/d dose of amlodipine significantly improved only time to onset of angina (treatment effect: 38.5 seconds, P=.036). Mibefradil 100 mg and 150 mg decreased the number of episodes of silent ischemia (treatment effects: -3.1 and -3.6, respectively; P<.001) and the duration of silent ischemia (treatment effects: -9.2 minutes, P=.048, and -14.6 minutes, P=.002, respectively). The decrease in the number of episodes of silent ischemia was also statistically significant in the group receiving 10 mg of amlodipine (-1.5; P=.036).\\ Once-daily doses of 100 and 150 mg mibefradil were effective in improving exercise tolerance and reducing ischemic episodes during ambulatory monitoring in patients with coronary artery disease.},

   Abstract={The use of calcium channel blockers in an elderly population recently was reported to be associated with the incidence of cancer. The Cardiovascular Health Study, a multisite observational cohort study, provided the opportunity to investigate the epidemiologic association between the use of calcium channel blockers and breast carcinoma risk in 3198 women age > or = 65 years.\\ Standard questionnaires and clinical procedures were administered at four study sites annually from 1989-1990 to 1993-1994. Drug usage was assessed by a medication inventory and hospitalizations for 75 incident invasive breast carcinoma cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases-9 Clinical Modification codes. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations between incident breast carcinoma and the use of specific antihypertensive medication including calcium channel blockers.\\ In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, an elevated risk of breast carcinoma was associated with use of calcium channel blockers (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-4.49). This association persisted when the comparison group was users of other antihypertensive medication. No associations between the use of other antihypertensive medication with incident breast carcinoma were found. Associations were enhanced by assessment of high dose at baseline (HR: 4.42; 95% CI, 1.37-14.27) and when calcium channel blockers were combined with estrogen use (HR: 4.48; 95% CI, 1.58-12.75). The association was found to be strongest for the use of estrogens with immediate release calcium channel blockers (HR: 8.48; 95% CI, 2.99-24.08).\\ Although the number of cases was limited in this observational study, associations found between the use of calcium channel blockers and incident invasive breast carcinoma warrant further investigation. Site specific carcinomas should be included as an outcome of ongoing and planned long term clinical trials using calcium channel blockers.},

   Abstract={Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in about 15% of people aged 60 years or older. In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly investigated whether active treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke combined was the primary endpoint.\\ All patients (> 60 years) were initially started on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, their average sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood pressure lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre, sex, and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were randomly assigned to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible addition of enalapril 5-20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25.0 mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients withdrawing from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We compared occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat.\\ At a median of 2 years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n = 2297) and by 23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the active treatment group (n = 2398). The between-group differences were systolic 10.1 mm Hg (95% CI 8.8-11.4) and diastolic, 4.5 mm Hg (3.9-5.1). Active treatment reduced the total rate of stroke from 13.7 to 7.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years (42% reduction; p = 0.003). Non-fatal stroke decreased by 44% (p = 0.007). In the active treatment group, all fatal and non-fatal cardiac endpoints, including sudden death, declined by 26% (p = 0.03). Non-fatal cardiac endpoints decreased by 33% (p = 0.03) and all fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular endpoints by 31% (p < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was slightly lower on active treatment (-27%, p = 0.07), but all-cause mortality was not influenced (-14%; p = 0.22).\\ Among elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment starting with nitrendipine reduces the rate of cardiovascular complications. Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years with this type of regimen may prevent 29 strokes or 53 major cardiovascular endpoints.},

   Abstract={Myocardial ischemia occurs frequently during daily life and has a circadian pattern similar to that reported for myocardial infarction and sudden death. Because of the increased risk of myocardial ischemia in the morning hours, it has been suggested that the administration of anti-ischemic medication before bedtime may be more effective than the traditional morning dosing. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated the effects of 480-mg/day diltiazem (given either in the A.M. or the P.M.) on myocardial ischemia using ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 68 patients with chronic stable angina and > or = 2 minutes of ischemia per 48 hours. During treatment with diltiazem, the duration and number of myocardial ischemic episodes were reduced by 45% (94 to 52 minutes, p <0.004) and by 40% (4.5 to 2.7 episodes, p <0.003), respectively. The duration and number of myocardial ischemic episodes during daytime (6 A.M. to 6 P.M.) hours were also reduced by 52% (74 to 36 minutes, p <0.002) and by 48% (3.1 to 1.6 episodes, p <0.001), respectively. There was no significant difference between A.M. and P.M. dosing. Morning ischemia (6 A.M. to noon), considered separately from daytime ischemia, was also significantly reduced by both A.M. and P.M. dosing regimens, with no difference between the regimens. The results of this study showed that both A.M. and P.M. dosing of long-acting diltiazem were equally effective in suppressing episodes of ambulatory myocardial ischemia at all times.},

   Abstract={Despite therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin morbidity and mortality in heart failure remain high and might respond favorably to an additional vasodilator.\\ Male patients (n=450) with chronic heart failure (cardiac dysfunction and impaired exercise performance) on optimal current therapy (97% enalapril, 89% diuretics) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with felodipine extended release (5 mg BID) or placebo for 3 to 39 months (average, 18 months). Felodipine significantly reduced blood pressure and, at 3 months, increased ejection fraction (2.1% versus -0.1% units in the placebo group, P=.001) and reduced plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels (-2.9 versus 26.9 pg/mL in the placebo group, P=.01) but did not improve exercise tolerance, quality of life, or the need for hospitalization. During long-term follow-up, the favorable effects on ejection fraction and atrial peptide did not persist, but felodipine prevented worsening exercise tolerance and quality of life. In the felodipine and placebo groups, mortality (13.8% versus 12.8%, respectively) and hospitalization (43% versus 42%) rates were similar, and a higher incidence of peripheral edema was the only apparent side effect of felodipine therapy.\\ Felodipine exerts a well-tolerated additional sustained vasodilator effect in patients with heart failure treated with enalapril, but the only possible long-term benefit was a trend for better exercise tolerance and less depression of quality of life in the second year of treatment. The drug appears to be safe but not clearly efficacious in patients with heart failure.},

   Abstract={The aim of the DANish trial in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DANAMI) study was to compare an invasive strategy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a conservative strategy in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia who received thrombolytic treatment for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\\ Of the 503 patients randomized to an invasive strategy, PTCA was performed in 266 (52.9%) and CABG in 147 (29.2%) from 2 to 10 weeks after the AMI. Of the 505 patients in the conservative treatment group, only 8 (1.6%) had been revascularized 2 months after the AMI. The patients were followed up from 1 to 4.5 years. The primary end points were mortality, reinfarction, and admission with unstable angina. At 2.4 years' follow-up (median), mortality was 3.6% in the invasive treatment group and 4.4% in the conservative treatment group (not significant). Invasive treatment was associated with a lower incidence of AMI (5.6% versus 10.5%; P=.0038) and a lower incidence of admission for unstable angina (17.9% versus 29.5%; P<.00001). The percentages of patients with a primary end point were 15.4% and 29.5% at 1 year, 23.5% and 36.6% at 2 years, and 31.7% versus 44.0% at 4 years (P=<.00001) in the invasive and conservative treatment groups, respectively. At 12 months, stable angina pectoris was present in 21% of patients in the invasive treatment group and 43% in the conservative treatment group.\\ Invasive treatment in post-AMI patients with inducible ischemia results in a reduction in the incidence of reinfarction, fewer admissions due to unstable angina, and lower prevalence of stable angina. We conclude that patients with inducible ischemia before discharge who have received treatment with thrombolytic drugs for their first AMI should be referred to coronary arteriography and revascularized accordingly.},

At week 12, statistically equivalent mean increases in exercise tolerance test (ETT) duration of > 1 minute were observed in both groups. Similar improvements in time to onset of angina and time to persistent 1 mm ST-segment depression were also observed with both drugs. Large reductions in heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product were observed at each stage of the ETT among patients treated with mibefradil. Each drug was associated with at least a 70% reduction from baseline in anginal frequency and nitroglycerin consumption. Patients maintained on mibefradil during the withdrawal period had significant increases in all three ETT variables at week 16 compared with placebo. The effectiveness of mibefradil is comparable with sustained-release diltiazem in treating chronic stable angina pectoris, although mibefradil provides greater reductions in heart rate and cardiac workload.},

   Abstract={Calcium channel blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but their proper therapeutic role is controversial. Nevertheless, drugs from this class have been evaluated in many controlled clinical trials of adequate size and duration in different patient populations. Although many important questions remain unanswered, these trials have clarified when and how these drugs should be used. In general, the benefits of calcium channel blockers in controlling angina and hypertension are much more clearly documented than are their long term effects on harder end-points such as mortality. Such long term data are sorely needed, particularly for hypertension. An increased risk with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has been clearly seen across several studies of patients with coronary disease. In coronary patients with heart failure, the deleterious effects of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil outweigh any possible benefit. Long acting formulations and newer calcium channel blockers may not share all of the adverse effects of the older drugs of this class; however, their long term safety has not yet been documented. An understanding of the limitations of calcium channel blockers, based upon clinical trial evidence, often leads the practitioner to choose a drug from another class, where efficacy has been clearly proven.},

   Abstract={Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with mild or moderate hypertension who received nifedipine with active drug controls. We performed a MEDLARS search using the MeSH heading "hypertension" and the text word "nifedipine" to identify all articles that were published between 1966 and August 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages and that involved human subjects. The computerized search was supplemented by a manual search of article bibliographies. Review of 1880 citations revealed 98 randomized controlled clinical trials that met protocol criteria. Articles were extracted independently by two doctors who were blinded for author, institution, and treatment regimen, using a structured, pretested extraction form. Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. Fourteen events occurred in 5198 exposures (0.27%) to nifedipine and 24 events in 5402 exposures (0.44%) to other active drug controls. Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively). The odds ratio for nifedipine in combination with another drug was significantly lower for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 and odds ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65, respectively). Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (P=.02 for definitive events and P=.001 for all events). Results support the safety of sustained- and extended-release nifedipine in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other drugs.},

   Abstract={We sought to determine whether the beneficial effects of amlodipine in heart failure may be mediated by a reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. We postulated that TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels may also have predictive value in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).\\ The molecular mechanism for progression of CHF may involve cytokine overexpression. The effect of amlodipine on cytokine levels in patients with CHF is unknown.\\ In the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation (PRAISE) trial, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure plasma levels of TNF-alpha in 92 patients and IL-6 in 62 patients in New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV randomized to receive amlodipine (10 mg/day) or placebo. Blood samples were obtained for cytokine measurement at baseline and at 8 and 26 weeks after enrollment.\\ The baseline amlodipine and placebo groups did not differ in demographics and cytokine levels. Mean (+/- SD) plasma levels of TNF-alpha were 5.69 +/- 0.32 pg/ml, and those of IL-6 were 9.23 +/- 1.26 pg/ml at baseline. These levels were elevated 6 and 10 times, respectively, compared with those of normal subjects (p < 0.001). Levels of TNF-alpha did not change significantly over the 26-week period (p = 0.69). However, IL-6 levels were significantly lower at 26 weeks in patients treated with amlodipine versus placebo (p = 0.007 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). An adverse event-CHF or death-occurred more commonly in patients with higher IL-6 levels.\\ Amlodipine lowers plasma IL-6 levels in patients with CHF. The beneficial effect of amlodipine in CHF may be due to a reduction of cytokines such as IL-6.},

   Abstract={The Syst-Eur trial is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutical trial in patients at least 60 years old and with isolated systolic hypertension. Its scope is to investigate the effects of modern antihypertensive drug treatment on morbidity and mortality and to assess possible adverse effects of the drugs used. Patients were recruited in 22 countries in western and eastern Europe and Israel. At three run-in visits 1 month apart their sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) on single-blind placebo treatment averaged 180-219 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for sex and the presence of cardiovascular complications, the patients were randomized either to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), titrated or combined to reduce the sitting SBP by at least 20 mm Hg to below 150 mm Hg. Matching placebos were employed similarly. The present progress report is based on the data received at the Coordinating Office before 1 March 1996. At that time 3433 subjects had been randomized. A total of 2015 patients had been followed for at least 1 year on double-blind treatment and 1298 patients for at least 2 years. At baseline BP was similar in both treatment groups and averaged 174/86 mm Hg. According to a per-protocol analysis at 1 year, BP fell (P < 0.001) on average by 22.6 +/- 15.7/6.0 +/- 8.0 mm Hg in the active treatment group and by 12.2 +/- 15.9/1.7 +/- 7.3 mm Hg in the placebo group. At 2 years BP was 10.2/5.7 mm Hg lower (P < 0.001) on active treatment than on placebo. At 1 year the percentage of patients who had reached goal BP was 19.9% in the placebo group and 41.4% in the active treatment group. At 2 years these percentages were 20.9 and 43.2 respectively.},

   Abstract={To examine the possible drug interaction between nifedipine and tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients.\\ A retrospective study was done comparing two groups of liver transplant recipients. The starting time for comparison was the same after transplant. One group (n = 22) consisted of hypertensive patients who were treated with nifedipine; the other group (n = 28) did not receive nifedipine. The two groups were compared over 1 year. The effect of nifedipine on tacrolimus was measured in terms of tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations, daily tacrolimus dosages, and cumulative tacrolimus dosages at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. All patient charts were reviewed with regard to concurrent medication that could affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and eventually affect tacrolimus concentrations and dosages.\\ All required information was retrieved from medical records.\\ There was a statistically significant difference between daily dosage requirements of tacrolimus at 90 (p = 0.03), 180 (p = 0.004), and 365 (p = 0.0004) days between the nifedipine and no-nifedipine groups. The tacrolimus daily dosage in the nifedipine group was decreased by 26%, 29%, and 38% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, compared with the dosage of the no-nifedipine group. Statistically significant differences in cumulative dosages of tacrolimus were observed at 180 (p = 0.02) and 365 (p = 0.003) days between the nifedipine and no-nifedipine groups, with cumulative dosage reduction of 25% and 31% by 6 and 12 months, respectively, in the nifedipine group compared with the no-nifedipine group.\\ Nifedipine decreased the daily and cumulative dosage requirement of tacrolimus. The interaction observed between nifedipine and tacrolimus is the first reported in humans and is clinically important. As a result of this drug interaction, it is recommended that blood concentrations of tacrolimus be monitored during coadministration of these drugs and that the tacrolimus dosage be adjusted accordingly.},

   Abstract={Safety in the drug treatment of hypertension can only be seen in relation to efficacy, which has now come to mean not just blood pressure (BP) reduction but improvements in hard end points including mortality. Information on safety can come from a variety of sources, in an ascending hierarchy, which is as follows: case-control studies, cohort studies, randomized control trials (RCTs), and metaanalyses based on good RCTs. Only in the case of metaanalyses are definite criteria for acceptability established, but evaluation of case-control and cohort studies remains subjective. Despite these reserves about the data sources, it is proposed that the case-control study pointing to the risk of acute myocardial infarction during therapy with short-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can be balanced out by another better more recent study, and by a large cohort study from Israel. In a very elderly population, a well-designed cohort study strongly suggests that short-acting nifedipine can be linked to increased mortality and that the specific links may be with a high dose and when the initial BP is less than 160/90 mm Hg. However, initial BP was only available in an unspecified number of patients. The risk of using short-acting verapamil was no more than that of beta-blockade. These differences can be attributed at least in part to the low catecholamine profile of verapamil and the marked rapid adrenergic activation with short-acting nifedipine, which could also explain the adverse effects found when this agent is given to patients with acute coronary syndromes. During the chronic use of long-acting dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs, most evidence suggests that there is little or no catecholamine activation, or in the case of amlodipine, even a decrease in plasma catecholamine levels. These differences may explain why the expected regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is obtained with long- but not short-acting DHPs. At present the results of several large randomized controlled trials with long-acting CCBs are awaited. In the meantime, when the decision has been made to use a CCB, the preferential choice is for the use of a non-DHP for hypertension with clinical ischemia or for postinfarct hypertension, for a long-acting CCB for the control of left ventricular hypertrophy, and for the DHP amlodipine when there is associated depression of myocardial function.},

   Abstract={Ca2+ channel blockers may cause cancer by inhibiting apoptosis or reducing intracellular Ca2+ in certain tissues. Recent findings suggest that drug users are at increased risk for cancer in general and for colon cancer in particular. We conducted a study in one Danish county of 17911 patients who received at least one prescription of Ca2+ channel blockers between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 1993. The patients were identified from records in the National Health Insurance Program, which refunds part of the price of such drugs. Cancer occurrence and rate were determined by use of the files of the Danish Cancer Registry and compared with county-specific incidence rates for various categories of cancer. During the follow-up period of up to 3 years, 412 cancers were observed among users of Ca2+ channel blockers, compared with 414 expected, to yield an age- and sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.10). There was no indication of an excess risk in the subgroup of likely long-term users or users of specific drugs. The SIR of colon cancer, a site of a priori interest, was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.1) on the basis of 34 cases. Although the results are reassuring, the lack of association could reflect the relatively short follow-up after registration in the prescription database. Continued monitoring of cancer risk is planned.},

   Abstract={This prospective study was designed to determine whether diltiazem is superior to digoxin for the prophylaxis of supraventricular dysrhythmias (SVD) after pneumonectomy or extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and to assess the influence of these drugs on perioperative cardiac function.\\ Seventy consecutive patients without previous SVD were randomly allocated immediately after pneumonectomy or EPP to receive diltiazem (n = 35) or digoxin (n = 35). Diltiazem-treated patients received a slow intravenous loading dose of 20 mg, followed by 10 mg intravenously every 4 hours for 24 to 36 hours, then 180 to 240 mg orally daily for 1 month. Digoxin-treated patients received a 1-mg intravenous loading in the first 24 to 36 hours, then 0.125 to 0.25 mg orally daily for 1 month. A concurrent prospective cohort of 40 patients without previous SVD, who did not participate in the study and underwent pneumonectomy or EPP without prophylaxis, served as a comparison group for SVD occurrence. Serial Doppler echocardiograms were performed to assess cardiac function and all patients were continuously monitored with Holter recorders for 3 days. Data were analyzed by intent-to-treat.\\ In patients undergoing standard or intrapericardial pneumonectomy, diltiazem prevented the overall incidence of postoperative SVD when compared with digoxin, 0 of 21 patients versus 8 of 25 patients, respectively, p < 0.005. When EPP patients were included in the analysis, diltiazem decreased the incidence of all SVD from 11 of 35 patients (31%) to 5 of 35 patients (14%) when compared with digoxin, p = 0.09. Digoxin-treated patients had a similar incidence of all SVD (31%) as concurrent controls (11 of 40 patients [28%]). The two treated groups did not differ in right or left atrial size, left ventricular ejection fraction, or right heart pressure. When all patients were combined, those in whom SVD developed were significantly older (65 +/- 12 years versus 55 +/- 11 years, p = 0.004) and had a longer median hospital stay (9 versus 6 days, p = 0.03), when compared with those in whom SVD did not develop, respectively. The subset of patients undergoing EPP had a greater incidence of atrial fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of postoperative pericarditis than all other pneumonectomy patients.\\ Diltiazem was both safe and more effective than digoxin in reducing the overall incidence of SVD after standard or intrapericardial pneumonectomy. Digoxin therapy had no effect on the incidence of postoperative SVD and is not recommended for prophylaxis of SVD. Dysrhythmias after pneumonectomy or EPP occur in older patients and are associated with a greater length of hospital stay.},

   Abstract={A randomized, double-blind, crossover study tested the antiischemic and antianginal efficacy of felodipine, extended-release 5-10 mg, versus amlodipine, 5-10 mg once daily. Fifty-two patients with documented exercise-induced angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia during 24-h electrocardiographic monitoring were included in the study. Forty-seven patients completed the 8-week treatment period, whereas five patients withdrew from the study. The mean number of ischemic episodes/24 h was reduced from 19.9 at baseline to 2.3 during amlodipine and to 2.4 during felodipine; the total duration of ischemic episodes decreased from 69.8 min/24 h to 15.2 min and 15.5 min during amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (for both variables, p = 0.83 and p = 0.53 between treatments, and for both treatments, p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Eighteen (38%) patients receiving amlodipine and 19 (40%) patients receiving felodipine showed no ST-segment depression during treatment. Maximal ST-depression was reduced from an average of 2.1 mm to 1.1 and 1.2 mm on amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (p = 0.68 between treatments and p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Mean heart rate remained unchanged compared with baseline. Anginal attacks were reduced from 16.4/week at baseline to 4.7/week with amlodipine and to 4.3/week with felodipine (p = 0.26 between treatments, and p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Accordingly, nitrate consumption was reduced from 14.7 capsules per week to 4.0 and 3.8 with amlodipine and felodipine, respectively (p = 0.40 between treatments, and p < 0.001 compared with baseline). Adverse reactions were infrequent and distributed similarly between the two treatments. It is concluded that both drugs effectively reduced ischemic episodes and anginal attacks and were well tolerated in patients with stable angina pectoris. There was no evidence that the two regimens were different in their antiischemic and antianginal properties.},

   Abstract={To compare 5 antihypertensive drugs and placebo for changes in quality of life (QL). To assess the relationship of lifestyle factors and change in lifestyle factors to QL in participants with stage I diastolic hypertension.\\ The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with minimum participant follow-up of 4 years. It was conducted at 4 hypertension screening and treatment academic centers in the United States. The cohort consisted of 902 men and women with hypertension, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressures less than 100 mm Hg. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature of the procedures had been fully explained. Sustained nutritional-hygienic intervention was administered to all participants to reduce weight, to reduce dietary sodium and alcohol intake, and to increase physical activity. Participants were randomized to take (1) acebutolol (n = 132); (2) amlodipine maleate (n = 131); (3) chlorthalidone (n = 126); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n = 134); (5) enalapril maleate (n = 135); or placebo (n = 234). Changes in 7 QL indexes were assessed based on a 35-item questionnaire: (1) general health; (2) energy or fatigue; (3) mental health; (4) general functioning; (5) satisfaction with physical abilities; (6) social functioning; and (7) social contacts.\\ At baseline, higher QL was associated with older age, more physical activity, lower obesity level, male gender, non-African American race, and higher educational level. Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups, including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater improvements in QL.\\ In patients with stage I hypertension, antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL. The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual.},

   Abstract={Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but mortality may be as high as 10% to 15% after 1 year. Verapamil prevents cardiac events after an AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in postinfarct patients with CHF already prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional treatment with verapamil may reduce cardiac event rate. In this multicenter, double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving diuretic treatment were consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 2 mg/day the following 2 months (n = 49), or to trandolapril as mentioned plus verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51). Trial medication started 3 to 10 days after AMI. All patients were followed for 3 months. End points in the trandolapril/trandolapril-verapamil groups were death 1/1, reinfarction 7/1, unstable angina 9/3, and readmission for CHF 6/2. The 3-month first cardiac event rate was 35% in trandolapril-treated patients and 14% in trandolapril-verapamil-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.85, p = 0.015). These data suggest that verapamil reduces cardiac event rates in post-AMI patients with CHF when added to an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic.},

   Abstract={In a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study, the anti-anginal and the anti-ischaemic efficacy of 12 weeks of therapy with the vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor-blocker carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d. was compared with verapamil 120 mg t.i.d.\\ During a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were required to have two treadmill exercise tests (modified Bruce Protocol) differing by not more than 15% with regard to total exercise time (TET). Of 313 patients enrolled, 248 were randomized and 212 completed the study according to the protocol.\\ The primary variable TET was analysed using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model to take into account censored values due to the patient stopping the exercise test for reasons other than angina. Forty-three per cent of patients allocated to carvedilol and 36% to verapamil did not stop with angina at the final visit. There was no difference in the TET between the groups, the risk ratio being 1.14 in favour of carvedilol (90% CI 0.85-1.52). TET increased from 378 s at baseline to 436 s at the final visit in the carvedilol group and from 386 to 438 s in the verapamil group. Results for time to angina and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression were similar. Compared to verapamil, carvedilol significantly reduced HR, systolic BP and rate pressure product at peak exercise. Analysis of 48 h Holter monitor data showed a greater reduction of HR and PVCs with carvedilol. Lown grading improved in both groups. Adverse events were reported by 48% (3.2% serious adverse events) of patients taking carvedilol and 58% (5.7% serious adverse events) taking verapamil.\\ Carvedilol is at least as effective as verapamil in the management of chronic stable angina and demonstrated a favourable adverse event profile.},

   Abstract={The gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation of nifedipine enables a once-daily dosing resulting in predictable, relatively constant plasma concentrations. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of this formulation and to compare this with the beta-blocker atenolol, we conducted a double-blind, randomised, multi-centre study in 129 male patients with documented exercise induced angina pectoris. After 4 weeks' treatment, nifedipine (60 mg), improved time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression from 536 s by 72 +/- 117s, time to onset of pain from 619 s by 56 +/- 120 s, and total exercise time from 685 s by 40 +/- 88 s. Atenolol 100 mg, had a comparable effect, time to onset of 0.1 mV ST-segment depression improved from 496 s by 53 +/- 129 s, time to onset of pain from 572 s by 57 +/- 118 s, and total exercise time from 653 s by 33 +/- 99 s. Between group analysis revealed no statistically significant differences for these exercise parameters. Atenolol, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced heart rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise (P < 0.001 between groups), indicating different modes of action of the drugs. With regard to safety, both drugs were generally well tolerated. There were significantly (P = 0.01) more vasodilation related side effects with nifedipine. These data demonstrate that gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation of nifedipine and atenolol as once-daily monotherapy are equally effective and safe, but with different effects on exercise parameters.},

The secondary objective is to determine equivalency of the effects of a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) as a first-line antihypertensive agent in the prevention and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consists of two study populations aged 40-74 years, 470 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure of > or = 90.0 mmHg at time of randomization) and 480 normotensive patients (diastolic blood pressure of 80.0 mmHg at time of randomization). The study duration is 5 years and is scheduled to end in May of 1998. Patients are randomized to receive either intensive antihypertensive drug therapy or moderate antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients are also randomized to nisoldipine or enalapril, with open-label medications added if further blood pressure control is necessary. The primary outcome measure is glomerular filtration rate as assessed by 24-h creatinine clearance. Secondary outcome measures are urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will also be evaluated. Given the data showing the impact of hypertension on complications in NIDDM, the ABCD Trial is designed to determine if intensive antihypertensive therapy will be more efficacious than moderate antihypertensive therapy on the outcome of diabetic complications in NIDDM.},

Our objective was to determine the prevalence and degree of hyperprolactinaemia associated with verapamil in the clinical setting.\\ Observation with cross-sectional and longitudinal components in the setting of an urban teaching hospital and its satellite out-patient clinics.\\ Male out-patients excluding those taking other drugs known to raise PRL, renal failure and known primary hypothyroidism (1265 eligible subjects). Control subjects were drawn from eligible out-patients not taking verapamil.\\ Serum PRL levels, frequency of persistent hyperprolactinaemia and total testosterone levels.\\ Prolactin levels were obtained in 449 subjects on verapamil (35.5% response rate) and 166 controls. The proportions of individuals with hyperprolactinaemia (PRL > 460 mU/l) were 0.085 and 0.030 in the verapamil and control groups, respectively (P = 0.012, X2-test). The mean (+/- SD) serum PRL levels were 267 +/- 205 and 203 +/- 118 mU/l in the verapamil and control groups, respectively (P < 0.001, independent t-test). Of the 38 patients with previously determined elevated PRL levels, follow-up data were obtained in 25 (65.8%); one was found to have a pituitary adenoma and was excluded from the analysis. Fifteen of the 24 were still on verapamil (Group 1) and 14 (93.3%) continued to be hyperprolactinaemic. In 9 patients verapamil had been discontinued (Group 2) and all had normal PRL levels. Continued verapamil use was associated with persistent hyperprolactinaemia (odds ratio > 120, P < 0.00001). The mean +/- SD serum testosterone levels at follow-up were significantly lower in Group 1 (6.16 +/- 2.52 nmol/l) than in Group 2 (9.42 +/- 3.92 nmol/l, P = 0.029, independent t-test).\\ The prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia associated with verapamil use in this study of male out-patients was 8.5% (95% CI 5.9-11.1%). The persistence of hyperprolactinaemia when verapamil was continued (Group 1) and the return to normal PRL levels when verapamil was discontinued (Group 2) confirm verapamil's causal role in the development of hyperprolactinaemia. While low testosterone levels were common in both groups, testosterone levels were lower in patients on verapamil. Our data suggest that screening for hyperprolactinaemia should be considered in male patients taking verapamil.},

   Abstract={Previous studies have shown that calcium-channel blockers increase morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. We studied the effect of a new calcium-channel blocker, amlodipine, in patients with severe chronic heart failure.\\ We randomly assigned 1153 patients with severe chronic heart failure and ejection fractions of less than 30 percent to double-blind treatment with either placebo (582 patients) or amlodipine (571 patients) for 6 to 33 months, while their usual therapy was continued. The randomization was stratified on the basis of whether patients had ischemic or nonischemic causes of heart failure. The primary end point of the study was death from any cause and hospitalization for major cardiovascular events.\\ Primary end points were reached in 42 percent of the placebo group and 39 percent of the amlodipine group, representing a 9 percent reduction in the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal events with amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 24 percent reduction to 10 percent increase; P=0.31). A total of 38 percent of the patients in the placebo group died, as compared with 33 percent of those in the amlodipine group, representing a 16 percent reduction in the risk of death with amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 31 percent reduction to 2 percent increase; P=0.07). Among patients with ischemic heart disease, there was no difference between the amlodipine and placebo groups in the occurrence of either end point. In contrast, among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, amlodipine reduced the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal events by 31 percent (P=0.04) and decreased the risk of death by 46 percent (P<0.001).\\ Amlodipine did not increase cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in patients with severe heart failure. The possibility that amlodipine prolongs survival in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy requires further study.},

   Abstract={Beta-blocking agents reduce mortality and improve symptoms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There have been reports that diltiazem, a calcium-blocking agent, is also effective in such patients. We prospectively compared the effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol with those of the calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in 18 patients (11 males and 7 females, age 14 to 68) with DCM. The 18 patients, (10 in New York Heart Association functional class III and 8 in class IV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Bisoprolol was administered as the first drug in 10 patients and diltiazem was administered in 8. Cross-over to bisoprolol was also performed in 3 patients. At the end of the study, among the 13 patients who had been given bisoprolol, 9 showed a good response (efficacy rate: 69%). In contrast, only 3 of the 8 patients who received diltiazem showed a good response (efficacy rate: 37.5%). Among the patients in NYHA class III, all 7 (100%) who were treated with bisoprolol responded but only 2 of the 4 (50%) treated with diltiazem responded (p < 0.05). Among the patients in class IV, 2 of 6 (33%) responded to bisoprolol and 1 of 4 (25%) responded to diltiazem (not significant). These results suggest that diltiazem, like bisoprolol, has a beneficial effect in patients with DCM, with a greater effect in class III patients. However, we conclude that diltiazem should usually be used as a second choice to improve heart failure in DCM, and as the first medication only in those with contraindications to beta-blocking agents.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE (PRIMARY END POINT): Rate of progression of mean maximum IMT in 12 carotid focal points over 3 years.\\ There was no difference in the rate of progression of mean maximum IMT between isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide over 3 years (P=.68). There was a higher incidence of major vascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, angina, and sudden death) in isradipine (n=25; 5.65%) vs hydrochlorothiazide (n=14; 3.17%) (P=.07), and a significant increase in nonmajor vascular events and procedures (eg, transient ischemic attack, dysrhythmia, aortic valve replacement, and femoral popliteal bypass graft) in isradipine (n=40; 9.05%) vs hydrochlorothiazide (n=23; 5.22%) (P=.02). At 6 months, mean DBP decreased by 13.0 mm Hg in both groups, and mean SBP decreased by 19.5 mm Hg in hydrochlorothiazide and 16.0 mm Hg in isradipine (P=.002); the difference in SBP between the 2 groups persisted throughout the study but did not explain the increased incidence of vascular events in patients treated with isradipine.\\ The rate of progression of mean maximum IMT in carotid arteries, the surrogate end point in this study, did not differ between the 2 treatment groups. The increased incidence of vascular events in patients receiving isradipine compared with hydrochlorothiazide is of concern and should be studied further.},

By using 24-h ambulatory BP measurements these reduction were 6/4 mm Hg (NS) and 13/8 mm Hg (P < 0.05), respectively. No significant difference for SBP and DBP was found during the night time between felodipine 2.5 and placebo (-1/0). Felodipine ER 5 mg lowered the BP load significantly during both daytime and night time but felodipine ER 2.5 mg only for DBP during the daytime. There was a significant difference for the number of responders between placebo (28%) vs felodipine ER 2.5 mg (55%) and ER 5.0 mg (59%). Both felodipine dosages and placebo were comparable in (a low) number of adverse events and results of the SSA.\\ During daytime felodipine ER 2.5 mg and 5 mg are effective in BP lowering in elderly hypertensive patients. However, only felodipine ER mg is effective in reducing BP during night time (22.00-7.00). Only felodipine ER 5 mg has a significant reducing effect on BP load during day and night time. Both felodipine ER 2.5 and ER 5.0 have a significant effect on the responder rate. It appeared from this study that compared to placebo, and in contrast with felodipine ER 5 mg, the ER form of felodipine 2.5 mg has no BP lowering effect during night time in elderly patients. To assess the effectivity during night time of felodipine ER 2.5 mg in an individual patient it is recommendable to measure the BP at the end of the dose interval.},

   Abstract={Quality of life is an important attribute of antihypertensive therapy. Previous studies have not addressed the importance of a patient's prior pharmacotherapy on quality of life, which may serve as the basis of reference for a new therapy. Nor have previous studies compared commonly used quality of life instruments for consistency, or investigated whether improvement or worsening of quality of life correlates with adverse events or blood pressure reduction. Two hundred eighteen hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (95 to 114 mm Hg) after a 4- to 5-week placebo washout period were enrolled in a randomized double-blind, parallel group dose-escalation trial to compare the effects of amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 6.25, and enalapril (5 to 20 mg) on blood pressure, adverse events, and quality of life. Three quality of life instruments (General Well-Being Index, Vital Signs Quality of Life, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) were administered during original therapy, after placebo washout, and after 12 weeks of optimally titrated clinical trial pharmacotherapy. Our results demonstrated that removal from prior therapy had no detectable influence on subsequent evaluation of quality of life. The three quality of life instruments were consistent with the changes observed with the three therapies: a trend toward better quality of life with amlodipine and bisoprolol/HCTZ. Adverse events, but not systolic or diastolic blood pressure reduction correlated directly with changes in quality of life.},

   Abstract={Calcium-channel blockers can alter apoptosis, a mechanism for destruction of cancer cells. We examined whether the long-term use of calcium-channel blockers is associated with an increased risk of cancer.\\ Between 1988 and 1992 we carried out a prospective cohort study of 5052 people aged 71 years or more and who lived in three regions of Massachusetts, Iowa, and Connecticut USA. Those taking calcium-channel blockers (n = 451) were compared with all other participants (n = 4601). The incidence of cancer was assessed by survey of hospital discharge diagnoses and causes of death. These outcomes were validated by the cancer registry in the one region where it was available. Demographic variables, disability, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, blood pressure, body-mass index, use of other drugs, hospital admissions for other causes, and comorbidity were all assessed as possible confounding factors.\\ The hazard ratio for cancer associated with calcium-channel blockers (1549 person-years, 47 events) compared with those not taking calcium-channel blockers (17225 person-years, 373 events) was 1.72 (95% CI 1.27-2.34, p = 0.0005), after adjustment for confounding factors. A significant dose-response gradient was found. Hazard ratios associated with verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine did not differ significantly from each other. The results remained unchanged in community-specific analyses. The association between calcium-channel blockers and cancer was found with most of the common cancers.\\ Calcium-channel blockers were associated with a general increased risk of cancer in the study populations, which suggested a common mechanism. These observational findings should be confirmed by other studies.},

   Abstract={A large number of randomized clinical trials have shown that thrombolysis, long-term treatment with beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, for calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil) there was either no benefit, or positive effects have been reported in subgroups only. Recent studies have raised concern about the safety of this drug class, especially in patients with coronary heart disease. We studied the long-term survival, for a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, of 1197 non-diabetic patients in the population-based AMI registry in Augsburg, Germany, aged 25-74 years, who had survived a first Q wave acute myocardial infarction for at least 28 days. The impact of thrombolysis and prescribed medication at discharge (beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and calcium channel blockers) on long-term survival was analysed using the Cox-Proportional-Hazard model, controlling for age, sex, and concomitant cardiac drug use. Thrombolysis (risk ratio, RR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.48-1.08), long-term beta-blockade (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.36-0.74) and antiplatelet drug use (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94) were associated with considerable reductions in total mortality. The use of calcium channel blockers was not associated with a reduction in total mortality (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.89-1.69). Separate analyses for nifedipine (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.68-1.48), and diltiazem (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.04-2.32) showed an increased risk of death associated with the latter. Using patients on beta-blockers only (RR 1.00) as a reference, the prescription of these calcium channel blockers was consistently associated with an increased total mortality (nifedipine, without beta-blockers RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-3.57, diltiazem, without beta-blockers RR 2.87; 95% CI 1.75-4.70). These results from an observational study demonstrate a benefit of thrombolysis, beta-adrenergic blockade and antiplatelet drug use on long-term survival in acute myocardial infarction patients. Calcium channel blocker use appears to be associated with an increased risk of death. These data support the need for controlled trials to address this issue specifically.},

   Abstract={Evidence is arising that calcium antagonists in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) may have beneficial effects on virus-induced cardiopathology, alcohol toxicity, micro-circulatory disorders, and impaired calcium cycling, all possibly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, the effect of adjunct diltiazem (60 to 90 mg TID) on standard treatment was investigated.\\ The Diltiazem in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DiDi) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of 186 patients (92 receiving diltiazem, 94 receiving placebo) with IDC diagnosed by coronary angiography, catheterization of the left side of the heart, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 0.50 (mean, 0.34 +/- 0.11). The effect of adjunct diltiazem treatment on transplant listing-free survival, hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and subjective status was investigated. During the 24-month study period, 33 patients dropped out of the study; 153 patients finished the study protocol. Twenty-seven patients died or had a listing for heart transplantation: 16 in the placebo group and 11 in the diltiazem group. The transplant listing-free survival rate was 85% for diltiazem and 80% for placebo recipients (P = .444). After 24 months, only diltiazem significantly increased cardiac index at rest (P = .01) and under a workload (P = .02), systolic and diastolic pressures (P = .003 and P = .004), stroke volume index (P = .003), and stroke work index (P = .000) and decreased both pulmonary artery pressure under workload (P = .007) and heart rate (P = .001). Diltiazem also increased exercise capacity (P = .002) and subjective well-being (P = .01). Adverse reactions were minor and evenly distributed in both groups, except for an increase in the PQ interval in the diltiazem group.\\ In patients with IDC, the adjunct therapy of diltiazem improves cardiac function, exercise capacity, and subjective status without deleterious effects on transplant listing-free survival.},

   Abstract={A randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial was conducted to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and effects on quality of life associated with treatment regimens including the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) added as needed, with regimens including the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine with HCTZ added as needed. The trial included patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) measurements were between 95 and 114 mm Hg, inclusive, at placebo baseline. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan or amlodipine in a double-masked, double-dummy fashion. A 4-week placebo washout period was followed by a 12-week active treatment period. Patients in the losartan arm (n = 97) were initially given 50 mg of oral (PO) losartan once a day (QD); the medication could be titrated to 50-mg losartan/ 12.5-mg HCTZ PO QD after 4 weeks, followed by 50-mg losartan plus 25-mg HCTZ PO QD after 8 weeks as necessary. Patients in the amlodipine group (n = 93) received 5-mg amlodipine PO QD, which could be titrated to 10 mg PO QD after 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg plus 25-mg HCTZ PO QD after 8 weeks. Medication was titrated upward as necessary to achieve trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life scores were assessed after 12 weeks of therapy with each regimen. Trough SiDBP reductions after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy were clinically comparable (losartan group: 7.3, 10.4, and 11.1 mm Hg, respectively; amlodipine group: 7.9, 11.2, and 11.8 mm Hg, respectively). Similar reductions in systolic blood pressure were also seen for both treatment groups. The percentage of patients reaching goal SiDBP (defined as trough SiDBP < 90 mm Hg or SiDBP > or = 90 mm Hg with a > or = 10 mm Hg drop from placebo baseline) was comparable for the two groups, with 68% of patients in the losartan group and 71% of patients in the amlodipine group reaching goal. Significantly more patients in the amlodipine group had drug-related adverse experiences (27% vs 13%). In particular, drug-related edema was more common in patients receiving the amlodipine regimen than in those receiving the losartan regimen (11% vs 1%). Patients in the amlodipine arm reported significantly more bother due to edema, regardless of whether edema was present at baseline, than did patients in the losartan arm (12% vs 2%), although overall quality of life was not different in the two treatment groups. This study demonstrates that a regimen of losartan with HCTZ added as needed, when compared with a regimen of amlodipine with HCTZ added as needed, provides comparable efficacy and superior tolerability and less bother to patients with respect to edema.},

   Abstract={It is established that phenytoin, cyclosporin and some calcium antagonists produce gingival overgrowth, but it is not known how this condition may respond to causal periodontal treatment. In order to find out, a longitudinal study was carried out, over a year, comparing a group of patients who were given nifedipine (NG, n = 18) and another group who were given diltiazem (DG, n = 13) with 2 others: one comprised cardiopathic patients who took no calcium antagonists (CG, n = 12) and the other contained patients who were medically healthy, with moderate periodontitis (HG, n = 12). On their basal visit, they were examined and instructed in oral hygiene, and then given causal periodontal treatment, being seen again at 4 and 8 months, when hygiene instructions were reinforced. They were seen for the last time at 12 months, when they were again examined. Groups NG and DG, on their basal visit, showed larger gum size than groups HG and CG, which was statistically significant; on their final visit, these differences remained only at the interproximal level. The number of patients with gingival overgrowth-taking the average of group HG as a minimal value-was much higher in groups CG (92%), DG (100%) and NG (89%) on the basal visit; on the final visit, the differences remained only in groups DG (85%) and NG (83%). The probing pocket depth reduction was much greater in groups HG and CG than in DG and NG, basically due to a greater gaining on clinical attachment level. The % of sites in which the pocket depth improved by more than 2 mm was 39.8% in HG, 54.5% in CG, 23.7% in DG and 28.7% in NG. The % of sites where the attachment gain by more than 2 mm was 46.2% in HG, 55.5% in CG, 22.8% in DG and 21.4% in NG. The amount of plaque and bleeding on probing, which was similar in all groups on the basal visit, decreased throughout the study, especially between the basal and 2nd visit in groups HG and CG. We have demonstrated that patients that take nifedipine and diltiazem show a larger gum size and their response to causal periodontal treatment is poorer than in the healthy and the cardiac groups.},

   Abstract={The Total Ischemic Burden Bisoprolol Study (TIBBS) follow-up examined cardiac event rates in relation to transient ischemia and its treatment.\\ It is unclear whether transient ischemia on the ambulatory electrocardiogram has prognostic implications in stable angina and whether medical treatment can improve the prognosis.\\ The TIBBS trial was an 8-week, randomized, controlled comparison of the effects of bisoprolol and nifedipine on transient ischemic episodes in patients with stable angina pectoris. Of the 545 patients screened, 520 (95.4%) could be followed up. Rates of cardiac and noncardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina and need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were recorded.\\ A total of 145 events occurred in 120 (23.1%) of 520 patients. Patients with more than six episodes had an event rate of 32.5% compared with 25.0% for patients with two to six episodes and 13.2% for patients with less than two episodes (p < 0.001). Hard events (death, acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina pectoris) were more frequent in patients with two or more ischemic episodes (12.2% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.0049). Patients with a 100% response rate of transient ischemic episodes during the TIBBS trial had a 17.5% event rate at 1 year compared with 32.3% for non-100% responders (p = 0.008). Patients receiving bisoprolol during the TIBBS tria had a lower event rate (22.1%) at 1 year than patients randomized to nifedipine (33.1%, p = 0.033).\\ In patients with stable angina pectoris, frequent episodes of transient ischemia are a marker for an increased event rate. A 100% response to medical treatment reduces the event rate. The greater reduction of ischemia with bisoprolol than nifedipine during the TIBBS trial translated into an improved outcome at 1 year.},

   Abstract={The PRESERVE (Prospective Randomized Enalapril Study Evaluating Regression of Ventricular Enlargement) study is designed to provide a definitive test of the ability of enalapril to achieve greater left ventricular (LV) mass reduction than nifedipine GITs (gastrointestinal treatment system) by a degree that would be prognostically meaningful on a population basis (10 g/m2). To achieve this goal, an ethnically diverse population of 480 men and women with essential hypertension and increased LV mass of screening echocardiography will be enrolled at clinical centers on 4 continents and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 6 and 12 months' randomized therapy. Blinded readings of echocardiograms at a central laboratory will provide systematic information about treatment effects on LV structure, wall motion, and Doppler blood flow. The study power is at least 90% to test the primary hypotheses that enalapril will induce greater normalization of LV mass and diastolic filling than nifedipine. After the 1-year echocardiographic trial, the study population will be followed 3 more years to test the hypothesis that a reduction in LV mass, independent of blood pressure lowering, is associated with a reduction in the risk of morbid and fatal cardiovascular events.},

   Abstract={Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonselective vasodilators (hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate) has become accepted treatment in patients with symptomatic, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and has been demonstrated in large clinical trials to ameliorate symptoms, improve exercise performance, and reduce cardiac mortality. Nevertheless, the management of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the average 2-year mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than that with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (25%) but, somewhat surprisingly, the nonspecific vasodilators produced significantly more improvement in exercise performance and left ventricular function. Such data suggest that improvement in symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be afforded by the use of a single class of vasodilator therapy, but might be optimized by the combined use of different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of chronic oral extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER) 2.5 to 5 mg twice daily, when added to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III CHF followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity which, in the doses used in this study, exerts its systemic arterial effect by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of additive vasodilator therapy in the management of patients with CHF.},

   Abstract={A randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial was conducted to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and effects on quality of life associated with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, alone or with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) in patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure measurements were between 95 and 115 mm Hg, inclusive, while receiving placebo. Patients were randomized to receive either losartan or nifedipine GITS in a double-masked, double-dummy fashion. A 4-week placebo washout period established baseline untreated blood pressure measurements and was followed by a 12-week active treatment period. Patients receiving losartan (n = 110) were initially given 50 mg once a day (QD) and could be titrated to losartan/HCTZ 50 mg/12.5 mg QD after 4 weeks followed by losartan/HCTZ 50 mg/25 mg QD after 8 weeks, as necessary. Patients in the nifedipine GITS group (n = 113) received 30 mg QD, which could titrated to 60 mg QD after 4 weeks followed by 90 mg QD after 8 weeks. Medication was titrated upward as necessary to achieve a sitting trough diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg. Efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life scores were assessed after 12 weeks of each therapy. Trough sitting diastolic blood pressure reductions after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy were clinically comparable: losartan, -8.9, -11.6, and -12.7 mm Hg, respectively, and nifedipine GITS, -9.3, -11.0, and -11.1 mm Hg, respectively, with the mean reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure at 12 weeks in the losartan group 1.6 mm Hg lower (95% confidence interval, 3.4 mm Hg lower to 0.3 mm Hg Higher) than the mean reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure in the nifedipine GITS group. Similarly, reductions in systolic blood pressure between the two treatment groups were comparable at all time points. The percentage of patients reaching the goal trough sitting diastolic blood pressure was comparable for the two treatment groups, with 74% of patients in the losartan regimen and 68% of patients in the nifedipine GITS regimen reaching the goal. Of patients reporting adverse events in the two groups (75 patients receiving losartan and 69 receiving nifedipine GITS), there was significantly more edema in the nifedipine GITS group (15% vs 4%; P = 0.005). Fourteen (12%) patients in the nifedipine GITS group were withdrawn due to an adverse event (eight of these were for edema). Six patients (5%) in the losartan group were withdrawn due to an adverse event (none of these patients had edema). There were significant differences in the patient-reported quality-of-life symptom bother inventory with respect to edema, with nifedipine GITS therapy causing significantly more bother due to edema in patients, regardless of whether that symptom was present at baseline (27% vs 9%; P = 0.0004). No statistically significant differences for bother due to the other symptoms in the inventory were noted. Of note, while the incidence of patient-reported symptom bother due to edema in the nifedipine GITS group was 27%, the incidence of physician-reported drug-related edema was 12%. This difference points to the need for improved physician-patient communication regarding adverse effects and their impact of patients' quality of life. In conclusion, a regimen of losartan, when compared with a regimen of nifedipine GITS, provides comparable efficacy, and with respect to edema, superior tolerability, less bother to patients, and fewer therapy dropouts.},

   Abstract={Recently, changes in antihypertensive therapies with similar properties have been made based primarily on cost savings for hospital formularies. To assess blood pressure (BP) control and adverse side effects associated with a switch of patients on nifedipine GITS to felodipine at our Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC), we prospectively studied physician records and patient-reported side effects (both from the medical record and patient questionnaires) in 127 hypertensive patients (70 +/- 10 years, 95% men, 88% nonblack, 44% with coronary disease) who underwent the forced switch in therapy. During the period of patient visits/chart review, physicians were unaware that the study was being conducted. A minimum of 2 months and two visits on each therapy was required for patient inclusion. The mean doses of nifedipine GITS and felodipine used were 55 +/- 24 mg/day and 8 +/- 2.6 mg/day, respectively. The use of supplemental antihypertensive agents was similar in both calcium channel blocker groups. Systolic BPs and heart rates were similar in patients taking the two drugs, and the diastolic BP was modestly lower in patients taking felodipine (78 +/- 10 mm Hg for felodipine and 80 +/- 10 mm Hg for nifedipine, P < .05). There were no differences in the incidence of side effects (both patient-reported and provider-reported) for the two antihypertensive therapies. These data demonstrate that in an hypertensive population followed in a VAMC, mandatory switching of stable dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker therapy did not result in any significant changes in short-term (2 to 3 months) BP control nor were adverse side effects different based on both physician- and patient- reported sources of information.},

   Abstract={L-propionylcarnitine, a naturally occurring derivative of L-carnitine, essential for mitochondrial fatty acid transport and high-energy phosphate exchange, acutely reduces myocardial ischaemia and improves ischaemia-induced cardiac dysfunction following intravenous administration. This randomized, crossover study was designed to compare the long-term anti-ischaemic effects of oral L-propionylcarnitine with diltiazem in patients with stable, exercise-induced angina. After a 2-week washout phase of anti-anginal medication and a 2-week single-blind placebo period, 46 patients were included in the study, 23 of whom received 1500 mg L-propionylcarnitine daily for 6 weeks, and 23 diltiazem (180 mg daily for 3 weeks, followed by 360 mg daily for 3 weeks), crossing over to the other treatment after a 1-week washout period. Three patients on L-propionylcarnitine and two on diltiazem discontinued. Both treatments resulted in comparable exercise duration (582 +/- 35 s and 588 +/- 33 s, mean +/- SEM), time to 0.1 mV ST depression (436 +/- 38 s and 465 +/- 36 s), and increase in time to 0.1 mV ST depression from baseline (20% and 28%), L-propionylcarnitine and diltiazem, respectively. Diltiazem decreased the rate-pressure product at rest and exercise, L-propionylcarnitine did not. Both compounds significantly reduced ST depression at maximal exercise [23% (L-propionylcarnitine) vs 35% (diltiazem), P < 0.05 diltiazem vs L-propionylcarnitine]. Diltiazem increased the time to onset of angina by 22%. In contrast, no significant changes occurred with L-propionylcarnitine. During the study, anginal attacks were reduced by 70% and 57%, and nitroglycerin consumption decreased by 57% and 70%, L-propionylcarnitine and diltiazem, respectively. Thus, both L-propionylcarnitine and (high-dose) diltiazem result in anti-ischaemic effects and decrease anginal attacks in daily life. Although the effect of diltiazem on exercise-induced ischaemia appears more pronounced than that of L-propionylcarnitine, this novel metabolic approach to ischaemia warrants further development.},

   Abstract={In animal models of salt-dependent hypertension, hyperfiltration is associated with a faster decline in renal function and there is evidence that in hypertensive man, increased creatinine clearance is a marker of early hypertensive nephropathy. We have studied the influence of salt intake on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Creatinine Clearance) in 14 patients with mild hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to a crossover design, at habitual salt intake, at high salt intake (ie habitual +50/100 mmol/day) and at low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein, calcium and potassium intake was fixed across the three study periods. The control group was formed by seven healthy subjects. High salt intake, caused a significant (P < 0.01) increase in 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the expected suppression in plasma renin activity (PRA) and in plasma aldosterone. Seven patients were classified as salt-sensitive. The GFR was significantly higher (P < 0.01) at high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than at habitual (113 +/- 7 ml/min) and at low salt intake (97 +/- 6 ml/min). On aggregate urinary salt excretion was significantly related with the GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation analysis for repeated observations) and the slope of this relationship predicted that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake is associated with the 14.6 ml/min rise in the GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24 h urinary salt in salt sensitive patients did not differ from that in salt resistant patients. The GFR response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system. No change in arterial pressure nor in GFR was observed in healthy subjects. At fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are associated with important GFR variations in mild hypertensives. As long as hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of renal function deterioration, high salt intake, independent of the effect of arterial pressure, could be a factor that contributes to nephronic obsolescence in patients with essential hypertension.},

QOL assessments in the hypertensives and in 155 normotensives included a self-structured scale to measure the subjective perception of QOL, the severity, desirability and controllability of recent critical life events, semantic memory, physical dysfunction, sleep disorders, sexual difficulties, depression and work-related stress. The overall withdrawal rate during the trial was 19%, mainly due to lack of efficacy and adverse experiences. At baseline, and at the end of the trial, the normotensives as compared to hypertensive patients, had significantly better scores in most QOL measures. Patients treated with the combination of isradipine and captopril reported more favorable changes in the subjective measure of QOL (P < 0.03) and in semantic memory (P < 0.001) than patients treated with any of the monotherapies or with methyldopa in combination with captopril. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for changes of other indices of QOL. In most QOL measurements, normotensives rated better then hypertensives. Patients treated on long-term therapy with the combination of isradipine and captopril showed improvement in self-structured QOL measures and semantic memory, compared to patients treated either with methyldopa or placebo.},

Of 339 patients who entered the study, 229 were eligible for the valid case analysis of efficacy and 335 for the safety analysis. Nifedipine GITS was significantly better than isosorbide dinitrate (P < or = 0.025) in prolonging time to 1 mm ST-segment depression, time to maximum ST-segment depression, time to occurrence of angina and total exercise duration, in addition to reducing the number of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption after six weeks therapy. Nifedipine GITS was also significantly better than isosorbide mononitrate (P < or = 0.025) in prolonging time to occurrence of angina and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression after six weeks therapy. The incidence of headache was considerably higher in both the isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide mononitrate groups (40% and 41%, respectively) than in the nifedipine GITS group (9.5%, P < or = 0.001), and was the main reason for withdrawal from the study (isosorbide dinitrate 18/99, isosorbide mononitrate 17/99, nifedipine GITS 2/95). Peripheral oedema was more common in patients treated with nifedipine GITS (12.5%) compared to nitrates (2% in both groups, P < or = 0.01), but resulted in withdrawal of only one patient (treated with nifedipine GITS). This study suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of nifedipine GITS is superior to long acting nitrates as second-line therapy to beta-blockade in the treatment of chronic stable angina.},

   Abstract={This study was designed to investigate whether combination therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine provides a greater anti-ischemic effect than does monotherapy in individual patients with stable angina pectoris.\\ Combination therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (which reduces myocardial oxygen consumption) and a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (which increases coronary blood flow) is a logical approach to the treatment of stable angina pectoris. However, it is not clear whether, in individual patients, this combined therapy is more effective than monotherapy.\\ Two hundred eighty patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in a double-blind trial in 25 European centers. Patients were randomized (week 0) to metoprolol (controlled release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily) for 6 weeks; placebo or the alternative drug was then added for a further 4 weeks. Exercise tests were performed at weeks 0, 6 and 10.\\ At week 6, both metoprolol and nifedipine increased the mean exercise time to 1-mm ST segment depression in comparison with week 0 (both p < 0.01); metoprolol was more effective than nifedipine (p < 0.05). At week 10, the groups randomized to combination therapy had a further increase in time to 1-mm ST segment depression (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Analysis of the results in individual patients revealed that 7 (11%) of 63 patients adding nifedipine to metoprolol and 17 (29%) of 59 patients (p < 0.0001) adding metoprolol to nifedipine showed an increase in exercise tolerance that was greater than the 90th percentile of the distribution of the changes observed in the corresponding monotherapy + placebo groups. However, among these patients, an additive effect was observed only in 1 (14%) of the 7 patients treated with metoprolol + nifedipine and in 4 (24%) of the 17 treated with nifedipine + metoprolol.\\ The mean additive anti-ischemic effect shown by combination therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris is not the result of an additive effect in individual patients. Rather, it may be attributed to the recruitment by the second drug of patients not responding to monotherapy.},

   Abstract={To assess the acute hemodynamic and long-term clinical effects of isradipine, a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine class, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study in 19 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Their mean age was 56 +/- 5 years, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.18 +/- 0.05. Patients were treated with diuretics and digoxin only. All were clinically stable and in sinus rhythm. The acute hemodynamic study showed that (intravenous) isradipine increased cardiac index (+36%) and stroke volume index (+30%) (both P < 0.001), while systemic vascular resistance (-33%) and mean arterial pressure (-10%) decreased (both P < 0.005). Filling pressures and heart rate were not affected. Of the 19 patients, 17 completed the 12 week study; 2 patients on placebo (1 death, 1 side-effects) but no patient on isradipine (5 mg 3 times daily) dropped out. After 12 weeks, peak oxygen consumption (VO2), LVEF, echocardiographic indices, and other clinical parameters were unaffected by treatment. Repeat invasive hemodynamic measurements showed that the initial improvement by isradipine was not present anymore. In conclusion, despite a beneficial acute hemodynamic effect, isradipine has no favorable clinical influence during prolonged treatment in patients with mild to moderate CHF.},

   Abstract={To evaluate the necessity and efficacy of quinidine fumarate, verapimil, or amiodarone prophylaxis for sinus rhythm maintenance in patients who experienced atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery.\\ Between 1992 and 1995, this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined 120 patients in whom atrial fibrillation occurred and was restored to sinus rhythm by pharmacological therapy or direct current cardioversion in the immediately postoperative period after coronary artery by-pass surgery. There were no significant differences in perioperative characteristics among the patients, who were randomly separated into four groups in the course of discharge. In group 1 (n = 30), patients did not receive antiarrhythmic drugs. Quinidine fumarate was given in group 2 (n = 30), verapimil in group 3 (n = 30), and amiodarone in group 4 (n = 30). Patients were monitored six times over a 90-day postoperative period by 24-hour Holter monitoring and routine examination.\\ The recurrent atrial fibrillation usually developed within 15 days of discharge. Atrial fibrillation occurred in one patient (3.33%) in group 1, and two each (6.66%) in groups 2, 3, and 4. Atrial fibrillation was asymptomatic and occurred with slow ventricular response in groups 3 and 4. Side effects occurred in 5 patients (16.6%) given quinidine, 1 patient given amiodarone, but in no patient given verapimil.\\ There were no significant differences in the maintenance of sinus rhythm among the four groups, so we suggest that long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting was not necessary at the postdischarge period.},

   Abstract={Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is currently the cornerstone of congestive heart failure (CHF) therapy, but these drugs are not tolerated in up to 20% of patients. For these patients, therapeutic alternatives with comparable efficacy are needed. Felodipine, a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a slow onset of action and a long plasma half-life, may be such an agent. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of felodipine were examined and compared with enalapril using a double-blind design. We studied 46 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.40, peak oxygen consumption < 20 ml.min-1.kg-1, and symptoms of CHF despite therapy with diuretics and digoxin. After 16 weeks of therapy, there were no statistically significant differences in peak oxygen consumption (felodipine +1.6, enalapril +2.5 ml.min-1.kg-1) and exercise tolerance (felodipine +61 seconds, enalapril +64 seconds). Quality-of-life parameters were affected slightly better by felodipine than by enalapril. Plasma norepinephrine decreased by 143 pg.ml-1 with enalapril and by 12 pg.ml-1 with felodipine (p < 0.20 between groups). Both drugs were generally well tolerated. These data suggest that felodipine and enalapril have comparable effects on exercise parameters in patients with CHF. Neurohumoral activation was not observed with either drug.},

   Abstract={The combination therapy of low-dose diltiazem or bexatolol with digoxin can be a useful adjunct for achieving heart rate control with minimal side effects. But there has not been a study including patients with impaired left ventricular function and evaluating whether the beneficial effects of medication will be maintained during a follow-up period.\\ The purpose of this study was three-fold: (1) to compare the efficacy of digoxin with low-dose diltiazem and digoxin with low-dose betaxolol on randomized crossover study; (2) to evaluate whether the beneficial effects of medication will be maintained after 7 months; (3) to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy in patients with impaired left ventricular function.\\ We did a prospective randomized crossover study in 35 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) including 15 patients with left ventricular dysfunction. After enrollment, each patient was evaluated for heart rate, blood pressure, rate-pressure products, maximal exercise tolerance at rest and during symptom-limited treadmill test before medication, at 4 weeks after medication of digoxin (0.125-0.5 mg daily) with diltiazem (90 mg twice daily), and at 4 weeks after digoxin with betaxolol (20 mg once daily). We performed 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) in 15 patients at the end of each phase of treatment. We repeated symptom-limited treadmill test like above method in 15 patients at 7 months of medication.\\ (1) Ventricular rates were significantly reduced in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy at rest and during exercise (67 +/- 3, 135 +/- 5 (mean +/- S.E.M.) beats/min, respectively) in comparison to digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (80 +/- 7, 154 +/- 5) (P < 0.05). (2) Rate-pressure products were significantly less in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol at rest and during exercise (85 +/- 4, 213 +/- 12 x 10(2) mmHg/min) than in digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (105 +/- 6, 269 +/- 12) (P < 0.05). (3) Exercise capacity was significantly improved in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol (9.3 +/- 0.5 METS) or digoxin with low-dose diltiazem (9.7 +/- 0.5) in comparison to control state (8.3 +/- 0.5) (P < 0.05). (4) At 7 months evaluation, there was no significant difference between at 4 weeks and at 7 months. (5) Results on 24-h ambulatory ECG showed the same findings as on treadmill test. (6) Although side effects occurred more frequently in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy, they were minimal and no patient had to withdraw medication. Worsening of left ventricular dysfunction was not observed.\\ Our study suggested that (1) combination therapy of low-dose betaxolol with digoxin was more superior to low-dose diltiazem with digoxin in controlling ventricular rate and reducing rate-pressure products; (2) the effects controlling ventricular rate, reducing rate-pressure products and improving exercise capacity have been well maintained even after 7 months of medication with each combination therapy.},

   Abstract={The additional efficacy, duration of action and tolerability of felodipine were evaluated in patients with stable angina pectoris and a positive stress test who were already receiving therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with 5-10 mg felodipine once daily or matching placebo, and were evaluated by serial exercise testing during 12 weeks of treatment. Felodipine at 4 h significantly increased exercise duration assessed after 4 weeks of treatment (increase 34 +/- 65 s vs 18 +/- 71 s in placebo-treated patients; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11; P = 0.01), and after 12 weeks of treatment (increase 39 +/- 103 s vs 3 +/- 72 s; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.16; P = 0.02). The time until onset of exercise-induced anginal pain and time until 1 mm ST depression assessed after 4 weeks of treatment also increased significantly with felodipine compared to placebo. No statistically significant changes in exercise test parameters evaluated 24 h after medication were observed. The addition of felodipine once daily demonstrated a sustained improvement in exercise duration in patients symptomatic despite treatment with a beta-blocker evaluated 4 h after drug intake. At 24 h post dose, no statistically significant effect was observed. Felodipine is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects and no adverse effect on quality of life.},

   Abstract={We investigated whether analysis of heart rate (HR) variability may be used to predict the efficacy of drug treatment of myocardial ischemia. In a double-blind, crossover study, 28 patients with stable angina pectoris, proven coronary artery disease, and myocardial ischemia during Holter monitoring received metoprolol controlled-release 200 mg once daily and diltiazem 60 mg 4 times daily. After a placebo run-in phase and after each treatment period, 72-hour Holter recordings were obtained for HR variability and ST-segment analysis. At baseline, the total duration of myocardial ischemia was 11.4 +/- 13.9 minutes (mean +/- SD per 24 hours), and the total number of episodes was 2.2 +/- 2.3. Metoprolol significantly reduced the total duration of ischemia by -8.7 minutes (95% CI -14.5 to -2.8) and the total number of episodes by -1.9 (-2.9 to -0.8) in patients with a low SD of normal-to-normal intervals at baseline (SDNN), using the median value of 50 ms as a cut-off value. In contrast, significant treatment effects were not observed in patients with a high SDNN at baseline. Similar results were obtained using baseline total power or low-frequency power, but not when using baseline heart rate. Diltiazem reduced the total duration of ischemia by -4.9 minutes (-9.7 to -0.1), but not the number of episodes. Moreover, in contrast to metoprolol, efficacy of diltiazem was not related to baseline HR variability. In conclusion, patients with reduced HR variability at baseline responded to treatment with metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In vitro diltiazem has fewer negative inotropic effects than verapamil. Clinically there are some reports of hemodynamic and clinical deterioration in patients with significant LV dysfunction given verapamil although most patients improve with verapamil. There are more data concerning diltiazem in the setting of AF complicated by congestive heart failure. The drug does not appear to exacerbate heart failure, although hypotension can result. In chronic AF complicated by heart failure, there is concern that diltiazem may increase mortality. Options for therapy are digoxin, beta-blockers and atrioventricular node ablation.\\ Calcium channel blockers may have a role in the acute reduction of ventricular response in patients with AF complicated by congestive heart failure; however, their safety in chronic heart rate control remains to be proven.},

Follow-up lasted for 1 year.\\ A composite outcome of the following measures was used to define success: attendance at the 12-month visit; at least nine supine DBP measurements during the study; and median supine DBP < 90 mmHg and a reduction of at least 10 mmHg compared with the baseline value. Failure was defined as one or more of those criteria not being fulfilled. Equivalence was concluded if the 95% confidence interval for the success rates differed between two groups by less than +/- 10%. Clinical safety and subjective quality of life were also assessed.\\ No statistically significant differences in the change in DBP or systolic blood pressure were observed between the groups. The success rates were 43.9, 42.0, 32.5 and 43.9% in diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium antagonist and ACE inhibitor groups, respectively. Equivalence between the treatments could not be concluded, although analysis with a larger equivalence interval showed that some comparisons indicated equivalence. Significant improvement in satisfaction was observed for certain items for subjective quality of life at 1 month in the calcium antagonist treatment group, and significant differences in the responses to the clinical safety questionnaire were observed after 1-month follow-up in calcium antagonist and beta-blocker groups. Differences were no longer significant after 9 months.\\ These results do not provide evidence on the basis of efficacy of blood pressure lowering or ability to increase short-term (1-year) safety and quality of life favouring any particular treatment among the studied drugs for newly diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.},

   Abstract={The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study is an ongoing prospective, randomized, multicenter trial conducted in 26 countries. Its two main aims are to evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients and the effects on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) compared with placebo. Altogether 19,193 patients have been recruited and randomized and one-year data are now available for all patients. This is a report on the blood pressures achieved, the tolerability and other available data after 12 months of follow-up of all patients. Special reference will be given to the subgroup of elderly patients (> or = 65 years, n = 6,113) as compared to younger patients (< 65 years, n = 13,080). On average, the target group < or = 90 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure has reached 86 mmHg, the target group < or = 85 mmHg has reached 83 mmHg and the target group < or = 80 mmHg has reached 81 mmHg. The percentage of patients that has obtained their target blood pressures is 84% in the target group < or = 90 mmHg, 72% in the target group < or = 85 mmHg and 57% in the target group < or = 80 mmHg at 12 months of follow-up. In the elderly subgroup (> or = 65 years of age) the percentage of patients at target is higher for all target groups, being 86, 76 and 61%, respectively, at 12 months. Antihypertensive treatment is initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at a dose of 5 mg once daily. If target blood pressure is not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, is given. Further dose adjustments are made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth and final step a diuretic may be added. Side effects have been relatively few in this large multinational series of intensively treated hypertensive patients. Only ankle edema, 2.6% and 3.0%, and coughing, 1.3% and 0.8%, in young and elderly patients, respectively, exceed a frequency of 1%, and 88% of all patients are still taking their baseline therapy felodipine after one year. The one-year data presented here indicate that it should be possible to fulfill the primary aims of the HOT Study.},

   Abstract={The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the dose of nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the increased risk of mortality seen in the randomized secondary-prevention trials and to review the mechanisms by which this adverse effect might occur.\\ We restricted the dose-response meta-analysis to the 16 randomized secondary-prevention trials of nifedipine for which mortality data were available. Recent trials of any calcium antagonist and formulation were also reviewed for information about the possible mechanisms of action that might increase mortality. Overall, the use of nifedipine was associated with a significant adverse effect on total mortality (risk ratio, 1.16, with a 95% CI of 1.01 to 1.33). This summary estimate fails to draw attention to an important dose-response relationship. For daily doses of 30 to 50, 60, and 80 mg, the risk ratios for total mortality were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.27), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.50), and 2.83 (95% CI, 1.35 to 5.93), respectively. In a formal test of dose response, the high doses of nifedipine were significantly associated with increased mortality (P = .01). While the mechanism of this adverse effect is not known, there are several plausible explanations, including the established proischemic effect, negative inotropic effects, marked hypotension, recently reported prohemorrhagic effects attributed to antiplatelet and vasodilatory actions of calcium antagonists, and possibly proarrhythmic effects.\\ In patients with coronary disease, the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses causes an increase in total mortality. Other calcium antagonists may have similar adverse effects, in particular those of the dihydropyridine type. Long-term safety data are lacking for most calcium antagonists.},

   Abstract={To assess the association between first myocardial infarction and the use of antihypertensive agents.\\ We conducted a population-based case-control study among enrollees of the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHC).\\ Cases were hypertensive patients who sustained a first fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction from 1986 through 1993 among women and from 1989 through 1993 among men. Controls were a stratified random sample of hypertensive GHC enrollees, frequency matched to the cases on age, sex, and calendar year. All 623 cases and 2032 controls had pharmacologically treated hypertension. Data collection included a review of the ambulatory medical record a brief telephone interview of consenting survivors. Antihypertensive therapy was assessed using the GHC's computerized pharmacy database.\\ The first analysis included only the 335 cases and 1395 controls initially free of cardiovascular disease. Compared with users of diuretics alone, the adjusted risk ratio of myocardial infarction was increased by about 60% among users of calcium channel blockers with or without diuretic (risk ratio = 1.62%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.11 to 2.34; P = .01). The second analysis was restricted to 384 cases and 1108 controls who were taking either a calcium channel blocker or a beta-blocker. Among these subjects, the use of calcium channel blockers compared with beta-blockers was associated with about a 60% increase in the adjusted risk of myocardial infarction (risk ratio = 1.57; 95% Cl, 1.21 to 2.04; P < .001). While high doses of beta-blockers were associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction (trend P = .04), high doses of calcium channel blockers were associated with an increased risk (trend P < .01).\\ In this study of hypertensive patients, the use of short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially in high doses, was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Ongoing large-scale clinical trials will assess the effect of various antihypertensive therapies, including calcium channel blockers, on several important cardiovascular end points. Until these results are available, the findings of this study support the current guidelines from the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure that recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as first-line agents unless contraindicated, unacceptable, or not tolerated.},

   Abstract={A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to test the peak and trough antianginal and antiischemic monotherapy efficacy and safety of a new extended-release formulation of nisoldipine (nisoldipine Coat Core [Bayer Corporation], 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg once daily compared to placebo). Study patients had a history of chronic, stable angina pectoris, exercise-induced angina in association with ST segment depression, and exercise test reproducibility. Of the 483 patients enrolled in the study, results were valid for safety analysis for 312 and for efficacy analysis for 284. There was a statistically significant improvement in total exercise time at both peak and trough for patients taking 20 mg and 60 mg of nisoldipine compared with patients taking placebo, but the group taking 60 mg was not better than the group taking 20 mg (33.9 and 33.7 seconds, respectively, at trough). The results were similar for the secondary endpoints (time to onset of angina and time to 1 mm ST segment depression). No correlation was evident between plasma nisoldipine levels and total exercise duration. Headache and peripheral edema were the most frequently reported adverse events and were dose related. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events in patients randomized to the 20-mg nisoldipine group. No deaths occurred while patients were receiving active nisoldipine therapy. Therapy with this extended-release formulation of nisoldipine is an effective once-daily treatment for chronic stable angina pectoris. It represents one of the few dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists that has shown efficacy when administered as monotherapy to patients with angina.},

   Abstract={To investigate the concept that the initial treatment of hypertension with low doses of two antihypertensives that have different modes of action and additive effects may achieve control of blood pressure and minimize the dose-dependent adverse effects seen with conventional monotherapy, a randomized, double-blind parallel group dose-escalation study was conducted. After a 4 to 5 week placebo washout period, 218 men and women with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg were randomly allocated to take: amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), enalapril (5 to 20 mg), and the low-dose combination of bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg) with 6.25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). All drugs were administered once daily, titrated to optimal response, and taken for a total of 12 weeks. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dose. The response rates (either a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg or a decrease of diastolic pressure > or = 10 mm Hg) were 71% for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, 69% for amlodipine, and 45% for enalapril. The mean decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure from baseline were 13.4/10.7, 12.8/10.2, and 7.3/6.6 mm Hg for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril, respectively. The mean change with enalapril was less than the other drugs (p < 0.01), although the once-daily dosing of enalapril and the maximum dose of 20 mg might not have been optimal for this agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

All subjects had reproducible treadmill exercise-induced angina at baseline, and after randomization they performed a serial exercise test 3 h after each dose for 4 weeks.\\ Zatebradine reduced rest heart rate both at 4 weeks ([mean +/- SEM] 12.9 +/- 1.23 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.6 [placebo] beats/min, p < 0.0001) and at the end of comparable stages of Bruce exercise (16.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.2 [placebo] beats/min, p < 0.0001). Despite the significant effects on heart rate at rest and exercise, there were no additional benefits of zatebradine from placebo baseline in measurements of total exercise duration, time to 1-mm ST segment depression or time to onset of angina. Subjects taking zatebradine also had more visual disturbances as adverse reactions.\\ Zatebradine seems to provide no additional antianginal benefit to patients already receiving nifedipine, and it raises questions regarding the benefit of heart rate reduction alone as an antianginal approach to patients with chronic stable angina.},

   Abstract={The maintenance of angina control was assessed in this multicenter (three sites), randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Patients with stable angina pectoris receiving twice-daily sustained-release (SR) diltiazem were switched to equivalent doses of once-daily controlled-delivery (CD) diltiazem or to diltiazem SR. Patients who were switched from diltiazem SR to diltiazem CD (n = 28) experienced a 5% increase in time to termination (p = 0.0004) on the exercise tolerance test (ETT), as well as an 8% improvement in time to onset of angina (p < 0.0001) on the ETT. A similar trend was observed in patients randomized to diltiazem SR (n = 7), which suggested a training effect, and, therefore, equal efficacy between diltiazem SR and diltiazem CD. During exercise testing in the diltiazem SR baseline phase, 77% of the patients did not experience angina, whereas 60% of the patients did not experience ST-segment depression. Following transfer to diltiazem CD, 79 and 61% of patients, respectively, remained angina- and ST-segment depression free. No significant changes in the number of angina attacks, nitroglycerin use, or any hemodynamic-related parameters were observed following transfer to diltiazem CD. Eleven percent of the patients receiving diltiazem CD experienced treatment-related adverse events, which were limited to headache and abdominal pain; these adverse events did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. These findings suggest that patients whose angina is controlled with twice-daily diltiazem SR can be safely and effectively switched to an equivalent daily dose of the once-daily diltiazem CD.},

   Abstract={This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new controlled-onset, extended-release formulation of verapamil hydrochloride called physiologic pattern release (PPR) verapamil. The study was conducted at 24 sites (13 United States, 5 Canada, 6 overseas; see Appendix). Following a 1- to 3-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, 278 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris (247 males, 31 females, mean age 60.8 years, range 32 to 78) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 once-daily, fixed-dose treatment groups: verapamil 180, 360, or 540 mg, or placebo. PPR verapamil at all doses significantly increased (p < 0.05) time to moderate angina and symptom-limited exercise duration, and verapamil 360 mg significantly increased (p < 0.05) time to > or = 1 mm ST-segment depression, after 4 weeks of treatment when assessed 24 hour after the previous dose. Larger doses of verapamil were associated with proportionately greater improvements in exercise tolerance. Frequency of anginal attacks was also reduced by verapamil. The most frequently observed adverse events were dizziness, headache, constipation, and nausea. The incidence of constipation was high (20.9%) within the 540 mg treatment group. This verapamil formulation can be clinically titrated within a 180 to 540 mg dosing range, permitting effective once-daily administration for the treatment of chronic stable angina.},

   Abstract={The present study was designed to investigate which characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test results could predict the favorable anti-ischemic effect of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol and the calcium antagonist nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris.\\ The characteristics of anginal symptoms and the results of exercise testing are considered of great importance for selecting medical treatment in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. However, little information is available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best pharmacologic approach in individual patients.\\ In this prospective multicenter study, 280 patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in 25 European centers. After baseline evaluation, consisting of an exercise test and a questionnaire investigating patients' anginal symptoms, the patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment for 6 weeks with either metoprolol (Controlled Release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily) according to a parallel group design. At the end of this period, exercise tests were repeated 1 to 4 h after drug intake.\\ Both metoprolol and nifedipine prolonged exercise tolerance over baseline levels; the improvement was greater in the patients receiving metoprolol (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that low exercise tolerance was the only variable associated with a more favorable effect within each treatment group. Metoprolol was more effective than nifedipine in patients with a lower exercise tolerance or with a higher rate-pressure product at rest and at ischemic threshold. None of the characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test results predicted a greater efficacy of nifedipine over metoprolol.\\ The results of a baseline exercise test, but not the characteristics of anginal symptoms, may offer useful information for selecting medical treatment in stable angina pectoris.},

The study consisted of a 3 x 2 factorial design wherein 186 men and women with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) of between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout, were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 4 weeks of active treatment. Monotherapy with both 240 mg verapamil and 10 mg enalapril reduced systolic and diastolic BP to a similar extent and significantly more than placebo. The 240 mg verapamil + 10 mg enalapril combination was additive for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; 120 mg verapamil + 10 mg enalapril was additive for systolic BP only. The total number of adverse events reported was similar for all six treatment groups. QOL scores were unchanged from baseline and not different between treatment groups. The combination of 240 mg verapamil and 10 mg enalapril was significantly more effective at reducing BP than either drug alone; this additivity of effect was not linked to a higher rate of adverse experiences or to a deterioration in QOL. Thus, combination therapy at lower doses may offer an alternative treatment option to higher dose monotherapy.},

   Abstract={This study examines skin rash, as a reported event, in the patients who used one of the 36 drugs recently released to the UK market and studied by Prescription-Event Monitoring between 1985 and 1992. The results are also compared to the voluntary reports on rash as a possible adverse drug reaction sent to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). Specific types of skin rash (e.g. exfoliative dermatitis) are excluded. The rate of rash has been calculated for 2 periods, the first month (T1) and the subsequent 5 months (T2) after the first prescription for the drug. Despite the heterogeneity of the patient groups, the rate for rash between the 2nd and 6th months was consistent in the 36 drugs and probably represented the baseline rate of rash due to a variety of nonspecific causes. This rate (T2) was around 1 per 1,000 patients per month (ranging from 0.5 to 2 per 1,000 patients per month). On the other hand, in the first month after the first prescription for the drug, the rate (T1) varied substantially from 0.9 to 6.4 per 1,000 patients per month. Diltiazem had the highest first monthly rate. These rates are listed for the 36 drugs. The difference of the rates was tested by 2 methods: a standard statistical test assuming a Poisson model and a method based on the ratio of the rates for the 2 periods. When the 2 rates (T1 and T2) were similar to each other, drug induced rash was considered to be rare.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   Abstract={The 3-month efficacy and safety of a once-daily controlled formulation of diltiazem (180 to 360 mg/day) were assessed in a study of 54 patients with angina pectoris. This multicenter study was a nonrandomized, placebo run-in, open-label, 3-month trial followed by a 1-week, double-blind, randomized period during which most patients (89%) received placebo. There were only minimal changes in the time to termination (mean change +/- SEM -5.8 +/- 9.6 seconds), time to onset of angina (10.5 +/- 12.2 seconds), and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression (2.9 +/- 12.5 seconds) from the end of the titration phase to the end of the open-label study. There were, however, statistically significant differences between the end of the 3-month treatment phase and the end of the 1-week randomized placebo phase for those 3 efficacy parameters (-37.3 +/- 11.2, -58.6 +/- 13.6, and -45.6 +/- 16.4 seconds, respectively). Diltiazem significantly decreased the frequency of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin use at the end of the 3-month treatment phase compared with results at the end of the randomized double-blind placebo phase. No new or unusual adverse events were reported during treatment. The present results suggest that there is no loss of efficacy of once-a-day diltiazem when administered for a long period to patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.},

Twenty-four-hour Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was carried out in 12 patients at three centers. In the first double-blind period amlodipine produced a significantly greater increase in symptom-limited exercise duration (amlodipine 478.5 to 520.6 vs placebo 484.6 to 485.2 seconds; change +8.8% vs +0.1%, respectively; p = 0.0004) and total work (amldipine 2426 to 2984 vs placebo 2505 to 2548 kilopondmeters; change +24% vs +1.7%, respectively; p = 0.0006) and a decrease in angina attack frequency (from 3 to 1 per week; p = 0.016) and nitroglycerin consumption (from 2 to 0.5 tablets/wk; p = 0.01) compared with placebo. Holter monitoring revealed significant reductions in numbers (amlodipine 4.65 to 2.22 vs placebo 1.84 to 1.54; change -52% vs +84%, respectively; p = 0.06), absolute total area (amlodipine 87.66 to 11.43 vs placebo 5.76 to 35.24; change -87% vs +513%, respectively; p = 0.02), and duration (amlodipine 12.29 to 2.95 vs 1.66 to 7.74 seconds; change -76% vs +367%, respectively; p = 0.008) of ST-segment depressions after treatment with amlodipine compared with placebo.

   Abstract={This study compared the effects of amlodipine, atenolol and their combination on ischemia during treadmill testing and 48-h ambulatory monitoring.\\ It is not known whether anti-ischemic drugs exert similar effects on ischemia during ambulatory monitoring and exercise treadmill testing.\\ Patients with stable coronary artery disease and ischemia during treadmill testing and ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 51) or atenolol (n = 49). Each group underwent a counterbalanced, crossover evaluation of single drug and placebo, followed by evaluation of the combination.\\ Amlodipine and the combination prolonged exercise time to 0.1-mV ST segment depression by 29% and 34%, respectively (p < 0.001) versus 3% for atenolol (p = NS). During ambulatory monitoring, the frequency of ischemic episodes decreased by 28% with amlodipine (p = 0.083 [NS]), by 57% with atenolol (p < 0.001) and by 72% with the combination (p < 0.05 vs. both single drugs; p < 0.001 vs. placebo). Suppression of ischemia during exercise testing and ambulatory monitoring was similar in patients with and without exercise-induced angina. Exercise time to angina improved by 29% with amlodipine (p < 0.01), by 16% with atenolol (p < 0.05) and by 39% with the combination (p < 0.005 vs. placebo, atenolol and amlodipine). In patients with angina, total exercise time improved by 16% with amlodipine (p < 0.001), by 4% with atenolol (p = NS) and by 19% with the combination (p < 0.05 vs. placebo and either single drug). In those patients without angina, no therapy significantly improved total exercise time.\\ Ischemia during treadmill testing was more effectively suppressed by amlodipine, whereas ischemia during ambulatory monitoring was more effectively suppressed by atenolol. The combination was more effective than either single drug in both settings.},

   Abstract={1. This placebo-controlled study assessed once daily sustained-release (SR) diltiazem, 200 and 300 mg, in 182 stable angina patients with positive exercise test. 2. Exercise testing was performed at baseline after a 7 day placebo run-in period, and repeated after 7 days of treatment, 25.0 +/- 0.1 h postdose. 3. Diltiazem (200 and 300 mg) produced respectively a 68% and a 64% decrease in weekly angina episodes, and placebo a 15% decrease (P < 0.05). Similarly, both dose levels produced a 70% decrease in nitroglycerin consumption, whereas no difference was obtained with placebo (P < 0.01). The increase in time to ischaemic threshold was significantly superior for 200 mg and 300 mg diltiazem when compared with placebo (75.2 and 91.5 s respectively vs 47.0 s) (P < 0.05); increase in time to anginal threshold was also significantly greater for diltiazem when compared with placebo (84.6 and 85.9 s respectively vs 43.9 s) (P < 0.05). 4. Only one patient experienced worsening of angina and had to be withdrawn from the study. 5. This study demonstrates 200 and 300 mg SR diltiazem is effective when given once-a-day in the prophylaxis of stable exertional angina. This once daily formulation should improve patients' compliance and comfort.},

   Abstract={We evaluated the acute antianginal effect of oral nisoldipine (10 mg), metoprolol (40 mg), and long-acting isosorbide dinitrate (20 mg) in 15 patients with stable exertional angina. The patients performed symptom-limited treadmill exercise at 2 h after the administration of placebo (Placebo stages 1 and 2) and each of the active drugs. After Placebo stage 1, the patients were randomized for cross-over evaluation of the acute effect of a single oral dose of placebo (Placebo stage 2), nisoldipine, metoprolol, or long-acting isosorbide dinitrate. All 15 patients developed angina during all of exercise tests and their exercise tests were terminated at the onset of angina. The time until development of 0.1 mV ST segment depression was increased by all three drugs compared to placebo, and it was significantly longer with metoprolol than with isosorbide dinitrate. Similarly, the time to ceasing exercise because of angina was also prolonged by all three drugs. The exercise time was longer with nisoldipine and metoprolol compared to isosorbide dinitrate, but there was no significant difference between nisoldipine and metoprolol. In conclusion, metoprolol and nisoldipine more effectively prolonged exercise compared to long-acting isosorbide dinitrate in patients with stable exertional angina.},

   Abstract={The effect of intensified blood pressure (BP) control with a reduction of the diastolic BP to < or = 85 mm Hg on renal function and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was studied in 28 men with primary hypertension (aged 62 to 72 years) treated for 13 +/- 5 years with beta-blockade, diuretics, or hydralazine. They were compared with 25 normotensive (NT) men of similar age. At baseline (BL), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) (clearance of inulin and para-aminohippurate), and the UAE were studied. Thereafter, all antihypertensive drugs except beta-blockers were withdrawn and either felodipine (5 to 20 mg; n = 13) or ramipril (2.5 to 10 mg; n = 15) was added in a double blind, randomized fashion. Hydrochlorothiazide was added if necessary. The investigations were repeated after 6 weeks and 1 year of double-blind treatment. At BL, the BP and the renal vascular resistance (RVR) were significantly higher and GFR and RPF were significantly lower in both hypertensive groups than in NT. After 1 year, the BP treatment goal was reached by all patients in the felodipine group but only by two-thirds in the ramipril group in spite of addition of diuretics to 60% of the latter group. In the felodipine group, the BP, GFR, and RVR after 1 year no longer differed significantly from normal. The UAE and the fractional albumin clearance increased significantly after 1 year's treatment in the felodipine group but did not change in the ramipril group. The fractional albumin clearance, however, did not differ significantly from normal either at BL or after 1 year's treatment in any of the hypertensive groups. It is therefore possible to reduce BP and improve renal function in primary hypertension to levels not significantly different from normal after treatment with felodipine in combination with beta-blockade. Although this regimen increased the low UAE slightly, the fractional albumin clearance changed less and did not differ significantly from normal. The ramipril/beta-blocker combination reduced BP less and did not change the slightly reduced renal function or the UAE.},

   Abstract={A double-blind safety and efficacy dose-ranging study was conducted with a new, once-daily, extended-release (XR) diltiazem hydrochloride formulation (Dilacor XR, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA) in 189 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. After a 2-week placebo lead-in phase, the patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 once-daily, fixed-dose treatment groups: placebo, XR diltiazem 120 mg, 240 mg, or 480 mg. Extended-release diltiazem, at 240-mg and 480-mg once-daily doses, significantly improved (P < .05) total exercise time during treadmill exercise tolerance testing after 2 weeks of treatment when assessed 24 hours after the previous dose. These increasing doses of XR diltiazem were associated with incremental improvements in exercise tolerance. Outpatient function, as assessed by frequency of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin use, and ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter, Scole Engineering Culver City, CA) monitoring of ischemic events, was also improved by XR diltiazem. This extended-release diltiazem formulation can be clinically titrated within the 120- to 480-mg dosing range, permitting effective once-daily administration for treating chronic stable angina.},

Time to the end of exercise showed no statistically significant difference between the two calcium antagonists. The onset of anginal pain and time to 1 mm ST depression were significantly more delayed by felodipine ER than nifedipine SR (22 s and 19 s, respectively, P < 0.05).

Therapeutic efficacy was assessed with maximal exercise tests, patient recordings on nitroglycerine consumption and angina attacks. No significant differences between the CR and plain tablets were seen in any of the efficacy variables. Maximal workload significantly increased from 127 W on placebo to 146 W on CR tablets and to 147 W on plain tablets. Anginal attacks/week significantly decreased from 11.7 on placebo to 4.9 on CR tablets and to 5.0 on plain tablets.

   Abstract={We compared the effects of bisoprolol on transient myocardial ischemia with those of nifedipine in patients with chronic stable angina.\\ Both beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium antagonists reduce transient ischemic episodes, but comparisons of these agents have been made in only a few larger studies.\\ The Total Ischemic Burden Bisoprolol Study (TIBBS) was a randomized double-blind controlled study with two parallel groups; 330 patients from 30 centers in seven European countries with stable angina pectoris, a positive exercise test and more than two transient ischemic episodes during 48 h of Holter monitoring (central evaluation) were included. Of these patients 161 were randomized to receive bisoprolol and 169 to receive nifedipine slow release. There were two treatment phases of 4 weeks each, with 48-h Holter monitoring after each phase. During phase 1, patients received either 10 mg of bisoprolol daily or 2 x 20 mg of nifedipine slow release. During phase 2, they received either 20 mg of bisoprolol daily or 2 x 40 mg of nifedipine slow release.\\ In phase 1 of the trial, 4 weeks of bisoprolol therapy (10 mg daily) reduced the mean [+/- SD] number of transient ischemic episodes from 8.1 +/- 0.6 to 3.2 +/- 0.4/48 h. Nifedipine (2 x 20 mg) reduced transient ischemic episodes from 8.3 +/- 0.5 to 5.9 +/- 0.4/48 h. Total duration of ischemia was reduced from 99.3 +/- 10.1 to 31.9 +/- 5.5 min/48 h with bisoprolol and from 101 +/- 9.1 to 72.6 +/- 8.1 min/48 h with nifedipine. Reductions were statistically significant for both drugs; the difference between bisoprolol and nifedipine was also significant (p < 0.0001). Bisoprolol reduced the heart rate at onset of episodes by 13.7 +/- 1.4 beats/min from a baseline value of 99.5 +/- 1.2 beats/min (p < 0.001). Heart rate was unchanged with nifedipine. Bisoprolol had significantly higher responder rates than nifedipine. Doubling of the dose in phase 2 of the trial had small additive effects. Only bisoprolol showed a marked circadian effect by reducing the morning peak of transient ischemic episodes (by 68% at peak time, 8:00 to 8:59 AM).\\ Both bisoprolol and nifedipine reduced the number and duration of transient ischemic episodes in patients with chronic stable angina. Bisoprolol was significantly more effective than nifedipine in both doses tested and reduced the morning peak of ischemic activity.},

Patients aged 59 years, with a reproducible exercise test on placebo, were randomised to 4 weeks of treatment with 200-300 SR (n = 70) or D (n = 74). The initial dosage was 200 mg in the 200-300 SR group and 60 mg t.i.d. in the D group, increased to 300 mg once daily or 60 mg q.i.d., respectively, if ergometric parameters, which were always measured at the end of the dosing period, had not improved after two weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, the antianginal efficacy at rest was comparable in the 200-300 SR and the D group; there was a prolongation of the total duration of exertion of 14% and 18% respectively (P < 0.01 vs placebo for both groups with no intergroup difference). A dose-effect relation was found with both formulations. The 200-300 SR formulation gave full 24 hour anti-ischaemic protection when administered once daily. Its efficacy and safety were comparable to those of standard diltiazem t.i.d. or q.i.d. in patients with stable angina. The once daily administration should improve treatment compliance.},

   Abstract={This study used Medicaid claims data from Pennsylvania to examine the costs and effects of changing calcium channel blocker therapies. Specifically, we compared Procardia XL with Adalat CC. They are the only once-daily-dosed, extended-release forms of nifedipine available. These drugs were interesting to compare for several reasons. First, because the frequency of treatment regimens has been shown to be the most important determinant of long-term compliance with calcium channel blocker medications, it was desirable to compare drugs having identical dosing regimens. Second, switching from one to the other should be quite feasible in most patients. Third, Adalat CC is priced (ie, average wholesale price) less than Procardia XL. The results indicate that prescription prices were lower when patients were switched from Procardia XL to Adalat CC, with no apparent effects on blood pressure control, the incidence of adverse drug reactions, or nonprescription health care costs. The potential savings to Medicaid from switching patients from Procardia XL to Adalat CC appears to be large, more than $2.5 million annually for Procardia XL-treated Medicaid patients in the state of Pennsylvania. Our study also demonstrates that large retrospective databases can be used to evaluate economic and clinical outcomes for specific therapy alternatives. Such evaluations are increasingly relevant to third-party payers, health maintenance organizations, and other parties involved in managed care.},

Event rates are expressed as the percentage of patients who experienced these events during the six months after the first prescription. The rates for all these events with the newer vasoselective dihydropyridines (nicardipine, isradipine and amlodipine) were higher than those with diltiazem. Among the three dihydropyridines, there were large individual differences in the rates. With nicardipine, the frequency of each of the four vasodilation-related events were similar to one another (approximately 3%). With isradipine, the rates were also similar to one another but all were approximately twice those measured in the nicardipine study (approximately 6%). These differences may have been due to confounding factors such as the publicity about adverse drug reactions, the indication for use by individual patients or the doses actually being used at the time the event occurred. With amlodipine, in contrast, the rate for oedema was two to four times larger than the rates for flushing, headache or dizziness.},

   Abstract={Coronary artery disease is an increasingly common medical problem in the elderly, and relatively few studies investigating drug therapy focus on this population. To assess the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), as adjunct to optimal beta-blocker therapy in elderly patients, a placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 46 patients, aged between 65 and 80 years, with documented stress-induced angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia. With use of a latin-square design, with 3 periods of 4 weeks each, exercise testing was performed after each period. Felodipine, 5 mg once daily, significantly improved both time to ischemic threshold and pain threshold (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003, respectively, vs placebo), and tended to increase total exercise time (p = 0.06 vs placebo). In contrast, ISMN, 20 mg twice daily, did not significantly affect these parameters. Comparison of the 2 active treatment arms showed that, overall, felodipine was more effective than ISMN, with a statistically significant difference for time to ischemic threshold (p = 0.02). With regard to safety, felodipine was also better tolerated than ISMN, which led to more patients discontinuing study medication with ISMN (p < 0.05 between ISMN and felodipine). It is concluded that in elderly patients who are treated with optimal beta blockade, felodipine, but not ISMN, leads to an additional significant reduction in ischemic parameters during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Because patients with silent ischemia are at higher risk of a cardiac event, they are likely to benefit not only from control of symptoms, but also from treatment directed at prevention of ischemia. The efficacy of controlled-release metoprolol 200 mg once daily and diltiazem 60 mg 4 times daily was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 32 patients with proven coronary artery disease, predominantly asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, positive bicycle exercise test results, and > or = 5 minutes of asymptomatic ST-segment depression on a 24-hour screening ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG). At the beginning and at the end of both 3-week treatment periods, an exercise test was performed and a 72-hour ambulatory ECG was recorded. Both active treatment periods were preceded by a 2-week placebo phase. Both treatments effectively reduced and postponed exercise-induced ST depression and reduced the total ischemic integral on the ambulatory ECG. Only metoprolol significantly reduced the mean number of ischemic episodes (54%, p = 0.0003, vs 31% for diltiazem, p = NS) and the mean duration of ischemia (51%, p = 0.012, vs 27% for diltiazem, p = NS) compared with baseline values. Metoprolol strongly blunted the morning and afternoon peak in the circadian distribution of ischemia, whereas diltiazem did not change the circadian distribution of ischemia at all.},

   Abstract={Fifty consecutive black patients with very severe hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure > or = 120 mm Hg and systolic > or = 210 mm Hg by the conventional cuff method) were treated in an open-label study (without a placebo or active drug control group) for 3 months with a long-acting preparation of isradipine (Dynacirc SRO), during which time serial changes in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), left ventricular (LV) mass index, and LV systolic function were evaluated. Mean 24-h ABPM was reduced from 184 +/- 13/119 +/- 6 to 148 +/- 18/96 +/- 11 mm Hg at 3 months (P < .0001). The reduction in BP was sustained for 24 h after dosing. Simultaneous BP measurements using a conventional cuff method and Dinamap were significantly different from the ABPM pre- and posttherapy, suggesting a marked "white coat" pressor effect. LV mass index regressed from 143 +/- 36 to 122 +/- 32 g/m2 at 3 months (P < .02). Heart rate and mean body weight were unchanged. Left ventricular performance was not adversely affected. Cardiac index and fractional shortening changed insignificantly, from 2.6 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2, and from 28 +/- 6 to 31 +/- 7%, respectively. Adverse effects were few and tended to disappear during the treatment period. All of the clinical laboratory parameters tested remained unchanged. We conclude that in this group of patients long-acting isradipine 1) showed a marked and sustained antihypertensive action demonstrated by 24-h ABPM; and 2) was well tolerated and associated with LV mass regression without adverse effect on systolic cardiac function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},
