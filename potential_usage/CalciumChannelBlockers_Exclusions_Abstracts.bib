   Abstract={Numerous studies have demonstrated that gingival overgrowth may be associated with androgen and cytokine expression in tissues.\\ The aim of this study was to compare the expression of androgen receptor-presenting cells (AR+ cells) and Th1/Th2 cytokine [Th1: interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma); Th2: IL-4, IL-10, IL-13] expression cells in tissue sections of patients with gingival overgrowth.\\ Tissue samples were collected from patients with healthy periodontium (H group), adult periodontitis (P group), surgically extracted teeth (S group), and nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (NIGO group). The clinical periodontal parameters of pocket depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque control record (PCR) were measured around selected sample teeth. Gingival biopsies were further processed by immunohistochemical staining method. The expressions of cells positive for AR, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were counted by predetermined semiquantitative methods.\\ Our results indicated that AR, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were intensively expressed in the nuclei of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts of gingival connective tissue. Stronger expressions of AR, IL-2, and IFN-gamma were found in the NIGO group. The AR+ cells/0.01 mm2 in gingival fibroblasts were significantly higher in the NIGO group (80.2 +/- 10.7) than those of the periodontitis group (52.5 +/- 11.8) and control group (37.4 +/- 11.3) (P < 0.05). The cytokine expression of the NIGO group showed a trend towards Th1-type expression (IL-2; P = 0.0001). In the surgically extracted tooth group, a stronger expression of Th2-type cytokine (IL-4, Il-10, IL-13; P < 0.05) was found in inflammatory cells. In a comparison of the IL-2/IL-4-labeled cell ratio of the four groups, a descending sequence was discovered as NIGO group (0.92 +/- 0.97) > H group (0.81 +/- 0.61) > P group (0.77 +/- 0.82) > S group (0.58 +/- 1.77).\\ Our data support the following: (i) taking nifedipine may elevate the expression of AR in susceptible oral tissue, e.g. gingiva; (ii) the cytokine profile of T-cells in NIGO tissue indicates a trend preferentially towards Th1 activity; and (iii) elevation of AR expression cells and prominent Th1 cytokine-labeled cells are two significant factors in the pathogenesis of NIGO.}

   Abstract={Our aim was to examine the relationships between serum hematocrit (Hct) and risk of all-cause mortality among patients with severe heart failure (HF).\\ Anemia occurs with increased frequency in severe HF. However, few studies have examined the impact of anemia on mortality in this population.\\ Using a prospective cohort design, we evaluated the relationships between baseline serum Hct and mortality among 1,130 patients with left ventricular EF <30% and New York Heart Association functional class IIIB or IV HF treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Mortality was ascertained by centralized adjudication.\\ The mean Hct was 41.8% (range 25.4% to 58.8%). Over 15 months of mean follow-up, there were 407 deaths (29 per 100 person-years). After adjustment for potential confounders, those in the lowest quintile of Hct (range 25.4% to 37.5%) had a 52% higher risk of death (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.10), compared with the highest quintile (range 46.1% to 58.8%). Within the lowest quintile of Hct, each 1% decrease in Hct was associated with an 11% higher risk of death (p < 0.01), whereas within the four higher quintiles of Hct, Hct was not associated with total mortality. Evaluation of different causes of death indicated that a lower Hct was strongly associated with death from progressive HF, rather than sudden death or other deaths.\\ Among patients with severe HF, anemia is a significant independent risk factor for death, with a progressively higher risk with increasing severity of anemia. Further investigation of the etiologies, prevention, and treatment of anemia in severe HF is warranted.}

   Abstract={In Finnish data from 1995-2000, 1006 fatal poisonings due to alcohol (ethanol), a single drug or both were statistically analysed in retrospect to evaluate the interaction between alcohol and drugs. In 53% of these cases, low concentrations of some common benzodiazepines were present. The median postmortem blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 3.3 percent per thousand (w/w) in the 615 alcohol poisonings, but significantly lower, ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 percent per thousand, when promazine, doxepin, amitriptyline or propoxyphene were found together with alcohol. When levomepromazine, temazepam or zopiclone were present, the median BAC was also significantly lower, 2.5-2.7 percent per thousand. Citalopram and diltiazem did not exhibit a significant effect. The median BAC was significantly lower in cases with high concentrations than in those with low concentrations of a drug (excluding citalopram), suggesting a positive concentration-effect relationship. Fatal toxicity indices (FTIs) were calculated by relating the number of deaths caused by a drug to the corresponding sales figures. Promazine had an extremely high FTI, followed by levomepromazine, propoxyphene, doxepin and amitriptyline. The other drugs had relatively low FTIs. The results reflect not only the acute toxicity of a given drug-alcohol combination but also the manners of use and abuse of these drugs.}

   Abstract={The Australian Intervention Randomized Control of Rate in Atrial Fibrillation Trial was a multicenter trial of atrioventricular junction ablation and pacing (AVJAP) compared with pharmacologic ventricular rate control (medication [MED]) in patients with mild to moderately symptomatic permanent atrial fibrillation (AF).\\ There have been very few prospective randomized trials, undertaken in highly symptomatic patients, comparing AVJAP with pharmacologic methods of ventricular rate control for patients with permanent AF.\\ There were 99 patients (70 men, mean age 68 +/- 8.6 years) at five centers. Forty-nine patients were randomized to AVJAP while 50 patients were randomized to pharmacologic control. The primary end point was cardiac function measured by echocardiography and exercise tolerance. The secondary end points were ventricular rate control, evaluated by 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and quality of life. Data were collected at randomization and then at one month, six months, and 12 months post-randomization.\\ At 12 months follow-up there was no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (AVJAP: 54 +/- 17%; MED: 61 +/- 13% [p = ns]) or exercise duration on treadmill testing (AVJAP: 4.1 +/- 2 min; MED: 4.6 +/- 2 min [p = ns]); however, the peak ventricular rate was lower in the AVJAP group during exercise (112 +/- 17 beats/min vs. 153 +/- 36 beats/min, p < 0.05) and activities of daily life (117 +/- 16 beats/min vs. 152 +/- 37 beats/min, p < 0.05). The CAST quality-of-life questionnaire revealed that patients in the AVJAP group had fewer symptoms at six months (p = 0.003) and at 12 months (p = 0.004). The observed relative risk reduction in symptoms at 12 months was 18%. Global subjective semiquantitative measurement of quality of life using the "ladder of life" revealed that the AVJAP group reported a 6% better quality of life at six months (p = 0.011).\\ In this trial, AVJAP for patients with mild to moderately symptomatic permanent AF did not worsen cardiac function during long-term follow-up, and quality of life was improved.}

   Abstract={The current prescription patterns for essential hypertension and the efficacy, safety, tolerability and cost-effectiveness of the newer antihypertensive drugs were evaluated in Nigerian patients. The findings were compared with that of a previous study conducted in the same tertiary hospital 10 years earlier. A cross-sectional evaluation of blood pressure (BP) control in a hypertension clinic was undertaken among 150 Nigerian patients aged 61 +/- 12 years (55% females), with a duration of treatment on a particular drug class or combination of 9 +/- 3 months. The initial blood pressure was 176 +/- 20/108 +/- 11 mmHg and 22% of the patient had concurrent diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics (D) alone or in combination remained the most commonly prescribed drugs in 56% of all patients. There were significant increases in the prescriptions of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (51%), P < 0.0001, and ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) (24%), P < 0.0001, but a slight reduction in the use of methyldopa, and fixed drug combinations (P < 0.01) compared to the previous study. The fall in systolic blood pressure on D (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) or CCB (r = 0.48, P < 0.02) was significantly correlated with the initial systolic blood pressure, but not age. More patients achieved normotension BP < 140/90 mmHg on CCB monotherapy (71%), than D monotherapy (56%). Combination therapy with ACEIs + D or methyldopa+thiazides normalized BP in 63 and 68%, respectively. Pulse pressure, a surrogate marker for cardiovascular complications and mortality in essential hypertension, was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) equally by all treatments, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -28 to -1 mmHg. However, hypertensive-diabetic (HT-DM) patients (n = 33) exhibited no significant change in pulse pressure in response to treatment. Adverse drug reactions that occurred in 11% were impotence or postural dizziness with D, headache and pitting oedema with CCB, and dry cough with ACEI. Pharmaco-economic comparison of the drug classes revealed that for every US dollar (dollar) spent per month, the percentage of treated patients attaining normotension was 18.6 for D, 4.73 for CCB, 3.5 for ACEI + D and 13.6 for methyldopa + thiazides. A combination of ACEI + CCB or D was the preferred treatment for hypertensive-diabetic Nigerians, but only 24% attained a BP < 130/85 mmHg. These results demonstrate a shift in trend to a more rational and efficacious treatment of hypertension over a 10 year period. This may be associated, at least in part, with the intensive and continuous education of the prescribers in rational drug use and the introduction of a hospital formulary. Methyldopa is still a highly efficacious and cost-effective drug in this population. Black HT-DM Africans still constitute a subgroup who not only require more and costlier antihypertensive drugs, but whose BP control is suboptimal, and exhibit a poor therapeutic response to other risk factors (pulse pressure) that constitute a continuing risk for cardiovascular mortality.}

   Abstract={The efficacy and safety of nisoldipine-extended release (ER) and amlodipine were compared in a 6-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, titration-to-effect trial in patients with stage 1 to 2 systemic hypertension (90 to 109 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure [BP]) and chronic stable angina pectoris. After a 3-week placebo run-in period, patients (n = 120) were randomly assigned to active treatment with either nisoldipine-ER (20 to 40 mg) or amlodipine (5 to 10 mg) once daily, titrated as necessary after 2 weeks to achieve diastolic BP <90 mm Hg. After 6 weeks, the mean reduction in systolic/diastolic BP from baseline was 15/13 mm Hg with nisoldipine-ER and 13/11 mm Hg with amlodipine (p = NS/p = NS). Both drugs resulted in similar BP responder rates (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg in 87% of patients who received nisoldipine-ER and 78% of patients on amlodipine, p = NS) and anti-ischemic responder rates (increasing exercise time >20% in 20% and 27%, respectively [p = NS], and increasing exercise time >60 seconds in 32% and 29% of patients, respectively [p = NS]. Also, after 6 weeks of active therapy, there was a similar mean increase in total exercise duration (23 seconds in the nisoldipine-ER group and 21 seconds in the amlodipine group, p = NS). Neither drug increased heart rate and both decreased frequency of anginal episodes. Adverse events were infrequent, and typically were vasodilator-related effects (including headache and peripheral edema) that occurred with somewhat higher incidence in the nisoldipine-ER group. Thus, nisoldipine-ER and amlodipine provided comparable antihypertensive and anti-ischemic efficacy, and both were generally well tolerated.}

The patients' mean age +/- SD was 66.5 +/- 18.1 years and mean length of stay was 13.2 +/- 9 days. Renal and hepatic insufficiency and previous history of drug intolerance were observed in 17.9%, 10.2%, and 2% of the hospitalized patients, respectively. Thirty-eight ADEs occurred in 32 patients; in 15 cases, ADEs were identified as the reason for admission, 10 cases occurred during hospitalization, and 13 cases were present at admission, but were not the cause of admission. The most frequent ADEs involved the neurologic (23.6%), renal (15.7%), and hematologic (13.1%) systems. Among these 38 ADEs, 22 were considered avoidable (57.9%); 20 of these were associated with therapeutic errors (inappropriate administration, drug-drug interactions, dosage error, drug not stopped despite the onset of ADEs). Patients with ADEs stayed longer in the hospital and took more drugs both before and during their hospital stay (p < 0.05).\\ Most of the ADEs observed in this study were avoidable. The risk/benefit ratio of administered drugs could be improved with better knowledge of the patients' medical history and the risk factors of ADEs.}

We report a case of an herbal preparation-induced rhabdomyolysis in a stable renal-transplant recipient, attributed to the presence of red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) within the mixture. The condition resolved when consumption of the product ceased. Rice fermented with red yeast contains several types of mevinic acids, including monacolin K, which is identical to lovastatin. We postulate that the interaction of cyclosporine and these compounds through the cytochrome P450 system resulted in the adverse effect seen in this patient. Transplant recipients must be cautioned against using herbal preparations to lower their lipid levels to prevent such complications from occurring.}

SETTING, DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective prescription-based study was carried out in seven out of 18 Health Centres in Bahrain. The study involved a registered population of 229,300 representing 46% of registered individuals, and 35 physicians representing 43% of all primary care physicians. The data was collected between November 1998 and January 1999 using chronic dispensing cards.\\ In all categories CCBs were the third commonly prescribed antihypertensive as monotherapy, with a prescription rate of 11.1% in uncomplicated hypertension, 18% in diabetic hypertension and 20.1% in elderly patients above 65 years of age. Nifedipine formulations were the most extensively prescribed CCBs. Almost half of the CCB-treated patients were on IR-nifedipine, whereas IR-diltiazem and IR-verapamil, and amlodipine were infrequently prescribed.\\ Prescription of IR-formulations of CCBs as monotherapy by primary care physicians does not conform with recommended guidelines. In view of concerns about the safety of such practice, measures to change the prescribing pattern are required.}

Potential DDIs were studied using a computerized detection program.\\ The elderly population used on average 7.0 drugs per person; 46% had at least 1 drug combination possibly leading to a DDI. On average, there were 0.83 potential DDIs per person. Almost 10% of the potential DDIs were classified to be avoided according to the Swedish interaction classification system, but nearly one-third of them were to be avoided only for predisposed patients. The risk of subtherapeutic effect as a result of a potential DDI was as common as the risk of adverse reactions. Furthermore, we found differences in the frequency and type of potential DDIs among the countries.\\ Potential DDIs are common in elderly people using many drugs and are part of a normal drug regimen. Some combinations are likely to have negative effects; more attention must be focused on detecting and monitoring patients using such combinations. As differences in potential DDIs among countries were found, the reasons for this variability need to be explored in further studies.}

   Abstract={Cyclosporin is a powerful stimulator of oxidative stress signaling, leading to TGFbeta production, NO degradation, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and post-transplant nephropathy. Carvedilol, alpha1-beta-blocker with strong antioxidant activity, may interfere with this chain of events. Therefore, we measured monocyte ecNOS, TGFbeta and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA level and plasma nitrite/nitrate, 3-nitrotyrosine, an estimate of peroxynitrite, and total plasma antioxidant power in kidney-transplanted patients with post-transplant hypertension, before and after treatment with carvedilol, 25 - 50 mg o.d. orally for 4 months (n = 15). The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine (n = 10) was used as comparator antihypertensive drug. Blood pressure fell to a similar extent with both drugs. Carvedilol increased plasma antioxidant power and HO-1 mRNA and reduced 3-nitrotyrosine and TGFbeta mRNA levels, while the same was not observed with nifedipine. Monocyte ec NOS mRNA levels and plasma nitrite/nitrate were higher in the patients than in a normotensive healthy control group and were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, carvedilol reduces the oxidative stress and corrects the altered cellular signaling mediated by oxidative stress in CsA-induced post-transplant hypertension. Therefore, it may prevent long-term complications, such as endothelial dysfunction, fibrogenesis and post-transplant nephropathy by decreasing NO degradation and production of TGFbeta, a key fibrogenic cytokine, and by activating HO-1 production.}

At the end of the second round, the pre-defined level of consensus was reached for 29 indicators (19 of the US generated indicators; 10 generated by the panel in the first round).\\ The Delphi results highlighted differences in both the clinical perspective and, possibly, philosophical viewpoints of health professionals practising in the UK and US health care systems. Further work, located in both primary and secondary care, is now in progress to operationalize the indicators. This process will form a key part of the refining, and hence further validation, of the indicators.

Also, the effect of these drugs on blood pressure, heart rate, renal functions and serum electrolytes, and their efficacy and tolerability in combination with digoxin were studied. This study was carried out in the Department of Medicine, Main Alexandria University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt, during the period May 1999 through to May 2000.\\ Diltiazem caused a significant increase in digoxin maximum serum concentration without significant change in time to reach maximum concentration and the apparent volume of distribution. The total digoxin clearance was significantly reduced and the elimination half life was prolonged. Subsequently the area under time-concentration curve and the steady-state digoxin level were increased, but were still within therapeutic margin. On the other hand isosorbide dinitrate significantly increased digoxin maximum serum concentration but without change in the other digoxin pharmacokinetic parameters. Isosorbide dinitrate, but not diltiazem, caused significant reduction in supine and standing blood pressure, while both drugs did not significantly alter pulse rate, renal functions, serum sodium potassium and electrocardiographic pattern.\\ Patients who received diltiazem displayed a mean 51% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, 50% increase in mean steady state serum digoxin concentration, and 37% increase in peak serum digoxin concentration. While patients who received isosorbide dinitrate showed only a 15% increase in digoxin maximum serum concentration and no statistically significant change in mean steady state digoxin concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve. The elimination half life during the diltiazem phase was prolonged by 29% while there was no significant change with isosorbide dinitrate. Netiher diltiazem or isosorbide dinitrate significantly altered the time to reach maximum serum digoxin concentration. The addition of a vasodilator such as, diltiazem or isosorbid dinitrate to digoxin could significantly improve the symptoms and signs of heart failure compared to digoxin alone. They were well tolerated and without fear of electrolyte imbalance which potentiate digoxin toxicity.}

   Abstract={To evaluate the incidence of serious adverse drug events (ADEs) caused by cardiovascular drugs during hospitalization in a department of internal medicine, and to identify patients at highest risk.\\ All the patients treated with cardiovascular drugs and/or anticoagulants in the department between November 1999 and January 2000 were recruited into the study. During hospitalization the patients' charts were reviewed by a pharmacist and a clinician, and the occurrence of serious ADEs was assessed using the Naranjo algorithm. 'Possible' and 'doubtful' ADEs were not counted.\\ Of 496 patients who were enrolled in the study, 20 (4%) had serious ADEs. Compared to patients without ADEs, patients in the ADE group were older (72 +/- 12.6 years (mean +/- SD) vs. 65 +/- 13 years, p = 0.048), their average stay in hospital was longer (7.3 +/- 5.5 days vs. 5.2 +/- 3.7 days, p = 0.018) and their mean urea levels were higher (10.8 +/- 9.3 mmol/l vs. 7.8 +/- 5.3 mmol/l, p = 0.027). The most frequent background pathologies of the 20 patients with ADEs were hypertension (in 18 (90%)) and atrial fibrillation (in nine (45%)). In 50% of the the ADE group there was a history of drug allergies. The ADEs recorded were bleeding in four (20%), arrhythmias in six (30%), orthostatic hypotension in six (30%) and skin necrosis, paranoid reaction, acute hepatitis and acute renal failure in four (20%). The causative drugs were warfarin (which accounted for 25% of the ADEs), beta-blockers (15%), propafenone (5%), amiodarone (5%), and Ca(2+)-channel blockers, nitrates and diuretics (together accounting for 50% of ADEs). Drug combinations were implicated in 50% of ADE.\\ Serious ADEs were developed by 4% of hospitalized patients taking cardiovascular drugs. Those at highest risk were older, were receiving multiple drug therapy and had higher urea levels. Warfarin and beta-blockers were the drugs causing the largest number of adverse effects. ADEs are an important cause of preventable morbidity, often with serious economic implications and special attention should be given to their prevention.}

   Volume="11",
   Number="2",
   Pages="71--78",
   Abstract={The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be guided by evidence of a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and therefore improved long-term outcome. Using pre-determined criteria, ten randomised, controlled trials that assessed the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on CV events in patients with hypertension were identified. Six of them enrolled a relatively small number (< 1500) of hypertensive patients, whereas four of the studies were much larger (> 4500 patients). The smaller studies produced mixed findings, especially those trials where CCBs were compared with diuretics; this may reflect methodological limitations and the impact of random error. The results from the four larger studies produced a consistent message: long-acting CCBs such as nifedipine, administered in a gastro-intestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation, nitrendipine and diltiazem, reduce CV morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. In the one study that specifically enrolled high-risk hypertensive patients, nifedipine GITS was as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing CV events, and in all four larger studies sub-group analyses showed that the benefits of these CCBs extend to hypertensive patients with diabetes. The available evidence supports the use of these long-acting CCBs as a first-line treatment option in hypertensive patients.}

   Abstract={The aim of the current study was to assess the ability of amlodipine to dilate the coronary vessels in subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries and normal left ventricular function. Ten patients, six women and four men (mean age 48 +/- 14 years, range 25-67 years) were enrolled. Coronary flow velocity and coronary perfusion pressure were invasively measured at baseline, during intracoronary adenosine (1-mg bolus) and at 5, 15, and 30 min following IV amlodipine (10 or 20 mg). Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at baseline and at 5, 15, and 30 min after amlodipine. Coronary cross-sectional area and mean coronary flow velocity progressively increased after amlodipine administration, resulting in an average increase in coronary flow at 30 min of 76%. On an individual basis, all patients but one showed a consistent trend toward a progressive coronary vasodilator effect of amlodipine over time. The peak effect of amlodipine on baseline mean coronary flow velocity was 43 +/- 12% that of adenosine. This is the first clinical study demonstrating that the IV administration of amlodipine produces a powerful coronary vasodilatation in subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries and normal ventricular function, besides its known systemic vasodilating effects. The coronary vasodilating properties of amlodipine are particularly expressed at the microcirculatory level.}

   Abstract={To assess the occurrence and pattern of adverse drug reactions as a cause for acute hospital admission.\\ In 681 randomly selected patients, acutely admitted to a clinic of internal medicine at a Swedish university hospital, information was collected from their medical records about current symptoms and use of drugs, previous diseases and the results of medical investigations and tests. In addition, a standardized interview according to a questionnaire was carried out. A group of experts in clinical pharmacology assessed the data obtained from the patients' case records and the results of the interviews, and then, according to WHO criteria, judged the probability that an adverse drug reaction could have caused or contributed to the actual admission to hospital.\\ Out of the 681 cases included, 94 (13.8%) had symptoms and signs that were judged as drug-related and that had caused or contributed to the admission. Eighty-two patients (12.0%) had altogether 99 symptoms that were classified as adverse drug reactions. Of these, 91% were type A reactions. The relationship between the medication and the reaction was judged certain in eight, probable in 17, and possible in 74 cases. The most common adverse drug reactions were cardiovascular (36.3%). Twelve patients (1.8%) had symptoms indicating intoxications.\\ The prevalence of drug-related problems causing or contributing to admission to a clinic of internal medicine is high and is dominated by type A reactions, i.e. reactions in principle predictable and preventable. This implies a possibility to increase drug safety by preventive measures.}

   Abstract={Calcium channel antagonists have been reported to have a favorable impact on cyclosporin A (CsA)-treated kidney transplant recipients. However, it is not clear whether this is because of their direct effect on antagonizing the toxicity of CsA to renal tubular cells. In this study, we have used Madin-Darby canine kidney tubular cells as a model to examine the effect of diltiazem, a calcium channel antagonist, on CsA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, to investigate the possible regulation of CsA cytotoxicity by intracellular calcium level, the effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 on CsA-induced apoptosis was also examined. We found that treatment of CsA (20 microM) alone caused 20-30% cell death, which was apparently (30-40%) enhanced by diltiazem at 100 microg/ml, accompanied by more severe DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases, and a decreased level of Bcl-2. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk or Bcl-2 overexpression was capable of suppressing apoptosis induced by the synergistic effect of diltiazem and CsA. Moreover, the survival rate of cells treated with CsA (30 microM) alone remained only 30%, however, it was markedly (approximately 40%) elevated by co-treatment with A23187 (75 ng/ml). The rescue of cells from CsA-induced apoptosis by A23187 was correlated with AKT activation, BAD phosphorylation, and caspase-3 inactivation. Taken together, our results suggest that the reported favorable impact of diltiazem on kidney grafts is likely not because of its direct protection on renal tubular cells. Instead, it enhances the toxicity of CsA to renal tubular cells. In addition, our findings raise a possibility that the intracellular calcium level and the AKT pathway may participate in the regulation of CsA cytotoxicity.}

   Abstract={Azimilide is a novel classification III antiarrhythmic agent that blocks both I(Kr)and I(Ks)and shows evidence of efficacy in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Its effect on paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) has not been reported.\\ One hundred ninety-three patients with symptomatic PSVT were enrolled in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with almost identical trial design (supraventricular arrhythmia-1 [SVA-1], SVA-2, SVA-3, and SVA-4), performed as a separate stratum of studies that also included a stratum of patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Patients received oral azimilide (100 mg in SVA-1 and SVA-3, 35 or 75 mg in SVA-2, and 125 mg in SVA-4) or matching placebo twice daily for 3 days (loading period), followed by once-daily dosing (maintenance period). The primary outcome variable was the first recording of a symptomatic supraventricular arrhythmia (either PSVT, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter) recorded on a transtelephonic electrocardiographic event recorder. The duration of study was 270 days in SVA-1 and SVA-2 and 180 days in SVA-3 and SVA-4. Combined analysis results of the PSVT stratum from the 4 studies showed a dose-response relationship in prolongation of time to recurrence (P =.02). In the combined 100-mg daily dose, the hazard ratio (placebo:azimilide) was 2.35 (P =.023). The hazard ratio for the 125-mg daily dose measured 1.28 (P = not significant). However, the time to recurrence was prolonged when the patients receiving 100 and 125 mg daily were combined and compared with placebo (P =.02). There were no deaths and 1 case of torsades de pointes.\\ These trial results suggest a significant dose-related suppression of PSVT with azimilide, with a low risk of serious adverse events.}

The study included 1,800 admissions corresponding to 1,663 patients.\\ Including definitive, probable and possible cases, 215 hospital admissions (11.9%) were drug-related ones. Of these cases, 108 (50.2%) corresponded to adverse drug reactions, 100 (46.5%) to dose-related therapeutic failures (mainly non-compliance) and 7 (3.3%) corresponded to intentional overdose. When 'possible' cases were excluded in order to achieve a better defined causative relationship, drug-related admissions dropped to 139 (7.7%). According to Schumock and Thornton criteria, 68.4% hospital admissions due to drug-related problems were considered 'avoidable'. Most avoidable admissions were due to non-compliance, absence of preventive therapy and inappropriate monitoring.\\ Hospital admissions due to drug-related problems are frequent and often preventable.}

Thus, the present investigation was designed to clarify the cross-reactivity among dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (nifedipine, nicardipine, and nisoldipine). Human gingival fibroblasts derived from seven, two, and one patients who developed gingival overgrowth as a result of nifedipine, nicardipine, and nisoldipine medications, respectively, were examined in terms of the effect of calcium-channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem, verapamil, and nicardipine) on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, collagen synthesis, and the number of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors. Phenytoin was used as a positive control. With most of the calcium-channel blockers and phenytoin, fibroblasts from patients reactive to nifedipine and nicardipine medications gave a better cell proliferation rate, DNA synthesis, and an increased number of EGF receptors, compared to non-drug-treated control. However, this was not the case for calcium-channel blockers tested in fibroblasts from patients reactive to nisoldipine medication.}

   Abstract={Increased renal vascular resistance and microalbuminuria are associated with hypertensive target organ damage and may be predictors of hypertensive nephrosclerosis.\\ We investigated changes in renal resistive index (RI) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in a group of patients with primary hypertension before and during long-term antihypertensive treatment.\\ Thirty-two patients were randomized to receive antihypertensive treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine GITS, up to 90 mg/day, n = 16) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril, up to 20 mg/day, n = 16), alone or in association with a diuretic (chlortalidone, 25 mg/day). Blood pressure, renal resistive index (by US Doppler) and UAE (mean of three nonconsecutive timed urinary collections, microg/min) were evaluated at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.\\ Both regimens effectively lowered blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 123 +/- 1.8 at baseline to 103 +/- 1.5 mm Hg at 24 months in the lisinopril group and from 122 +/- 1.9 at baseline to 104 +/- 0.8 at 24 months in the nifedipine group, p < 0.001 for both groups). Overall, blood pressure decrease was associated with a reduction in UAE and no change in RI throughout the study. However, despite similar blood pressure reduction, the two regimens showed different specific effects. Lisinopril was associated with a significant decrease in both UAE (33.8 +/- 16.2 at baseline and 9.1 +/- 2.1 at 24 months, p < 0.01) and renal RI (0.61 +/- 0.02 at baseline and 0.56 +/- 0.04 at 24 months, p < 0.05) while nifedipine GITS did not significantly influence UAE (35.7 +/- 12.2 at baseline and 31.2 +/- 12.1 at 24 months, n.s.) or RI (0.61 +/- 0.01 at baseline and 0.59 +/- 0.02 at 24 months, n.s.).\\ Effective blood pressure control over a long period of time reduces the severity of organ damage, namely UAE while maintaining renovascular resistance in patients with essential hypertension. Different classes of antihypertensive agents might convey additional specific renal protection beyond blood pressure control. These data could be useful in devising individualized therapeutic strategies in hypertensive patients at increased renal risk.}

   Abstract={A noteworthy shift from class I to class III antiarrhythmic agents for suppression of atrial fibrillation has occurred. Sotalol, amiodarone, and dofetilide have been evaluated for their ability to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. All of these agents are moderately effective; however, amiodarone appears to be most efficacious. Aside from their common class III actions, these agents have profoundly different pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, safety, and drug interaction profiles that help guide drug selection. Amiodarone and dofetilide are safe in patients who have had a myocardial infarction and those with heart failure. The safety of commercially available d,l-sotalol in these patients is poorly understood. Torsades de pointes is the most serious adverse effect of sotalol and dofetilide, and risk increases with renal dysfunction. Amiodarone has minimal proarrhythmic risk but has numerous noncardiac toxicities that require frequent monitoring. Overall, an ideal antiarrhythmic agent does not exist, and drug selection should be highly individualized.}

   Abstract={Recent clinical trials aimed at attenuating complications in diabetes mellitus have generated interest in the impact of drug formulation and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in diabetes. Specifically, it has been proposed that the diabetic state may alter the pharmacokinetics of several cardiovascular drugs, including some calcium antagonists. The present study investigates the effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amlodipine in hypertensive subjects with and without diabetes mellitus to determine whether the diabetic state alters these parameters. This trial consisted of a 2-week placebo washout phase, a 2-week titration phase, and a 2-week maintenance phase. Study patients included 18 hypertensive patients with type II diabetes mellitus and 10 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. Blood samples were collected after administration of amlodipine and AUC, Cmax, and tmax were determined. The acute 24-hour pharmacodynamic response to amlodipine was assessed by blood pressure and telemetric heart rate measurements. There were no significant differences for either amlodipine 5 or 10 mg in AUC (p = 0.40 for 5 mg; p = 0.59 for 10 mg), Cmax (p = 0.41 for 5 mg; p = 0.45 for 10 mg), and tmax (p = 0.79 for 5 mg; p = 0.67 for 10 mg) between diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensive subjects. Similarly, the 24-hour pharmacodynamic effects of amlodipine on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate did not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects as assessed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Because of the theoretical basis for anticipating that diabetes mellitus may provoke important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations, our study provides an important database in clearly demonstrating that the diabetic milieu did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of amlodipine.}

Selection of the effective single dose and control over the drug effectiveness in regular intake was carried out using treadmill tests made at the height of the drug activity (peak effect) and before taking the next dose (end effect).\\ 1 patient quitted the trial because of frequent anginal attacks while amlodipin administration. Both drugs showed positive effect in relation to exercise tolerance, peak effect of diltiazem was significantly higher than that of amlodipin, the end effect was the same. Amlodipin increased the heart rate at rest while diltiazem insignificantly decreased it. Amlodipin induced side effects more often, all of them were typical for dihydropiridin calcium antagonists.\\ Amlodipin and diltiazem of prolonged action have pronounced antianginal effect, diltiazem being more effective and less toxic.}

   Abstract={The dual aims of treating patients with chronic stable angina are 1) to reduce morbidity and mortality and 2) to eliminate angina with minimal adverse effects and allow the patient to return to normal activities. In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy. All beta-blockers seem to be equally effective. If the patient has serious contraindications to beta-blockers, unacceptable side effects, or persistent angina, calcium antagonists should be administered. Long-acting dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine agents are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line therapy because a nitrate-free interval is required to avoid developing tolerance. All long-acting nitrates seem to be equally effective. Patients with angina should take 75 to 325 mg of aspirin daily unless they have contraindications. Such risk factors as smoking, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, diabetes, and hypertension should be treated appropriately. Coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve survival for most patients with chronic angina but may be required to control symptoms. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often indicated for symptomatic patients with left-main disease, three-vessel disease, or two-vessel disease including proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery; it improves their survival. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is an alternative to CABG for patients with normal left ventricular function and favorable angiographic features. Coronary artery bypass grafting is initially more effective in relieving angina than medical therapy, but the two procedures yield similar results after 5 to 10 years. Eighty percent of patients who undergo CABG remain angina-free 5 years after surgery. In low-risk patients, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty seems to control angina better than medical therapy, but recurrent angina and repeated procedures are more likely than with CABG. Patient education is an important component of management. Long-term follow-up should be individualized to ascertain clinical stability at regular intervals and to reassess prognosis when warranted.}

   Abstract={The most frequent side-effects of drug therapy are skin eruptions. Their pathomechanism is rather unclear.\\ In this prospective study we investigated the T cell activation and drug specificity in different forms of drug-induced exanthemas from 22 patients.\\ During acute drug allergy, liver parameters and T cell subset activation in the circulation (up-regulation of CD25 and HLA-DR) were evaluated and skin biopsies of the acute lesion performed. After recovery, the causative drug was identified by lymphocyte transformation (LTT) and scratch-patch tests.\\ Seventeen of 22 (17/22) patients had maculo-papular exanthema, 4/22 bullous exanthema and 1/22 urticaria. The causative drugs were mainly antibiotics, anti-epileptics and anti-hypertensives. Up-regulation of HLA-DR on circulating CD4(+) and/or CD8(+) T cells was detected in 17 patients, being most marked in patients with bullous reactions or hepatic involvement. The LTT was positive in 14/21 analysed and the patch test in 7/15. All patients showed lymphocytic infiltration in the skin biopsy of the acute lesion. Generally CD4(+) T cells dominated; a higher percentage of circulating CD8(+) T cells was found in patients with bullous skin reactions or hepatic involvement.\\ Our data demonstrate activation and drug specificity of T cells in drug-induced skin eruptions. A predominant CD8(+) T cell activation leads to more severe (bullous) skin symptoms or liver involvement, while predominant activation of CD4(+) cells elicits mainly maculo-papular reactions.}

   Abstract={Data on patients receiving antihypertensive therapy were collected from 20 general practitioners (GPs) in Campania, Italy, to determine the prescription of different antihypertensive classes and their use with other drugs for concomitant diseases, to investigate the main factors influencing antihypertensive choice, to document treatment outcome, and to assess adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Each GP completed a data card for each consultation that produced an antihypertensive prescription; 1900 cards were collected. The most frequently used antihypertensives were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (49.6%), calcium antagonists (24.8%), beta blockers (11.7%), angiotensin II-receptor blockers (5.5%), and alpha blockers (0.9%). In 82% of patients, blood pressure was reduced but did not reach normotensive levels. The choice of antihypertensive treatment was influenced by international guidelines (56%), clinical diagnosis (25%), concomitant diseases (8%), cost (4%), compliance (3%), and other factors (5%).

   Abstract={Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression of renal disease in patients with type 1 diabetes, but similar data are not available for patients with type 2, the most common form of diabetes. We assessed the role of the angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist losartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.\\ A total of 1513 patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind study comparing losartan (50 to 100 mg once daily) with placebo, both taken in addition to conventional antihypertensive treatment (calcium-channel antagonists, diuretics, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and centrally acting agents), for a mean of 3.4 years. The primary outcome was the composite of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary end points included a composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes, proteinuria, and the rate of progression of renal disease.\\ A total of 327 patients in the losartan group reached the primary end point, as compared with 359 in the placebo group (risk reduction, 16 percent; P=0.02). Losartan reduced the incidence of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration (risk reduction, 25 percent; P=0.006) and end-stage renal disease (risk reduction, 28 percent; P=0.002) but had no effect on the rate of death. The benefit exceeded that attributable to changes in blood pressure. The composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes was similar in the two groups, although the rate of first hospitalization for heart failure was significantly lower with losartan (risk reduction, 32 percent; P=0.005). The level of proteinuria declined by 35 percent with losartan (P<0.001 for the comparison with placebo).\\ Losartan conferred significant renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, and it was generally well tolerated.}

   Abstract={Is cancer related to hypertension and blood pressure? Do antihypertensive drugs promote cancer? Do antihypertensive drugs protect against cancer? We previously analysed the frequency of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in elderly people who participated in the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension 2 (STOP-Hypertension-2). We have also looked at the frequency of cancer in these patients.\\ We randomly assigned 6614 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age 76 years, median time of follow-up 5.3 years) to one of three treatment strategies: conventional drugs (diuretics or b-blockers), calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors. We matched the patients to the Swedish Cancer Registry and compared our findings with expected values based on age, sex, and calendar-year-specific reference frequencies for the general Swedish population. We also compared the number of cancers between the three treatment groups.\\ At baseline, 607 (9%) patients had previous malignant disease. Diagnoses were closely similar to the distribution of cancer types that might be seen in elderly patients. During follow-up, there were 625 new cases of cancer in 590 patients. The frequency of cancer did not differ significantly between the treatment strategies, including all cancers and those at individual sites. The standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for all cancers were also close to unity: 0.92 (95% CI 0.80-1.06) for conventional drugs, 0.96 (0.83-1.10) for calcium antagonists, and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for ACE inhibitors.\\ No difference in cancer risk was seen between patients randomly assigned to conventional drugs, calcium antagonists, or ACE inhibitors. Thus, the general message to the practising physician is that more attention should be given to getting the blood pressure down than to the risk of cancer.}

   Abstract={To determine the antihypertensive drug prescribing pattern by primary care physicians in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension; to identify whether such pattern of prescription is appropriate and in accordance with international guidelines for pharmacotherapy of hypertension; and to estimate the impact of such prescriptions on cost of treatment.\\ A prescription-based survey among patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension was conducted in seven out of a total of 18 health centres in Bahrain. The relevant data for our study was collected using cards, designed for chronically-ill patients.\\ A total of 1019 male and 1395 female (62.9%) out of 3838 of the study population were on monotherapy, whereas 596 male and 828 female (37.1%) were on antihypertensive combination therapy. Among the monotherapy category, the various antihypertensive drugs used were as follows: beta-blockers (58.8%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (14.2%), calcium channel blockers (11.1%), diuretics (8.1%) and alpha-methyldopa (7.0%). With respect to overall utilization pattern, beta-blockers were the most frequently prescribed (65.5%), diuretics ranked second (27.4%), followed by ACE inhibitors (20.6%), calcium channel blockers (19.9%) and alpha-methyldopa (8.5%). Within each class of antihypertensives used, the most frequently used individual agents were as follows: (a) among beta-blockers 97.7% used atenolol; (b) among the diuretics, indapamide (35.4%), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (32.7%), HCTZ in combination with triamterene (25.7%), and chlorthalidone (4.6%); (c) among the ACE inhibitors, captopril (44.9%), enalapril (29.7%), and lisinopril (19.0%); (d) among the calcium channel blockers, nifedipine (98.2%). Significant age- and gender-related differences in prescribing patterns were seen. Short-acting nifedipine monotherapy was inappropriately prescribed in a significant number of patients above the age of 50 years. ACE inhibitors accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total antihypertensive drug expenditure, although these drugs represent only one-fifth of overall antihypertensives used. There is a trend towards excessive use of expensive thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide which seems to be unjustifiable practice, particularly in a study population free from diabetic hypertensive patients.\\ The general pattern of antihypertensive utilization appears to be in accordance with the guidelines of WHO and the Joint National Committee issued in the 1990s. The trends of prescribing of antihypertensives were in favour of conventional ones such as the beta blockers and diuretics, and the introduction of newer classes of antihypertensives had a generally minimal impact on the prescribing profile. Almost two-thirds of the patients were treated with monotherapy. A disproportionately large percentage of antihypertensive drug cost was due to overt use of ACE inhibitors, and indapamide, instead of thiazide diuretics. The use of short-acting calcium channel blockers especially in the elderly is unjustifiable.}

   Abstract={Drug-induced gingival overgrowth is a known side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of systemic disorders. The pathogenesis and mechanisms responsible for this condition are not fully understood. This study assesses for the presence and localization of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in drug-induced gingival overgrowth tissues. CTGF immunostaining was compared with sections stained with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and CD31 antibodies in order to investigate possible pathogenic mechanisms.\\ Gingival overgrowth samples were obtained from patients undergoing therapy with phenytoin (n = 9), nifedipine (n = 4), cyclosporin A (n = 5), and control tissues from systemically healthy donors (n = 9). Tissue sections were subjected to peroxidase immunohistochemistry and were stained with CTGF and TGF-beta1 polyclonal primary antibodies. Possible relationships between CTGF staining and angiogenesis were also studied using an anti-CD31 antibody as a marker for endothelial cells. Staining was analyzed by computer-assisted quantitative and semiquantitative methodology at 5 defined sites in all samples based on the location of specific landmarks including epithelium and underlying connective tissues.\\ Cellular and extracellular CTGF content in phenytoin gingival overgrowth tissues was significantly (P<0.05) higher compared to the other gingival overgrowth tissues and the controls. Higher CTGF staining in phenytoin gingival overgrowth tissues was accompanied by an increased abundance of fibroblasts and connective tissue fibers. No strong association of CTGF staining with TGF-beta1 or CD31 staining was found.\\ The data from the present study show significantly higher CTGF staining in phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth tissues compared to controls, cyclosporin A-, or nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth. Moreover, semiquantitative analyses of histologic samples support the concept that the phenytoin overgrowth tissues are fibrotic. These associations suggest a possible role for CTGF in promoting development of fibrotic lesions in phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.}

   Abstract={Recent hypertension trials have demonstrated the importance of achieving goal blood pressures to reduce the risk of target organ damage. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, the use of high-dose monotherapy and/or combinations of drugs are necessary to achieve these goals. Fixed-dose combination products may be useful in these patients by reducing the number of daily doses required to control blood pressure.\\ The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic interchange between high-dose calcium channel blocker therapy and a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/ benazepril (Lotrel; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, USA) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.\\ A total of 75 patients were switched from amlodipine (n = 25), felodipine (n = 25), and nifedipine-GITS (n = 25) to amlodipine/benazepril. Twenty-eight of the 75 patients (37%) were taking either a beta-blocker or a diuretic in addition to the high-dose calcium channel blocker prior to the switch. Blood pressure control, side effects and the cost of the therapeutic interchange were evaluated in the year following the therapeutic interchange.\\ Sixty-six of the 75 (88%) patients were successfully switched with maintenance of blood pressure control and without the development of new dose-limiting side effects. Reasons for treatment failure after the therapeutic interchange included loss of blood pressure control in five patients and the development of new dose-limiting side effects in four patients. These side effects included cough in three patients and rash in one patient. After accounting for differences in drug acquisition cost and costs related to the switch (clinic and emergency room and laboratory tests), a cost savings of $16030 for all 75 patients was realised in the first year. The per patient-per year cost savings was $214.\\ Our data indicate that a therapeutic interchange from selected high-dose calcium channel blockers to a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/ benazepril can be successfully accomplished in the majority of patients.}

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulfate versus diltiazem therapy in patients with prolonged episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\\ In a prospective randomized trial, 46 symptomatic patients presenting with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were given intravenous magnesium sulfate (n=23) or diltiazem (n=23) therapy. Primary outcome measures were effects on ventricular rate control and proportion of patients restored to sinus rhythm at 6 h after initiation of treatment.\\ There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Both forms of treatment were well tolerated, with no adverse clinical events. Both drugs had similar efficacy in reducing the ventricular rate at the first hour of treatment (P<0.05) with a tendency toward a further decrease during infusion times of 2 (P<0.01), 3, 4, 5 and 6 h, respectively (P<0.001). However, at the end of the 6-h treatment period, restoration of sinus rhythm was observed in a significantly higher proportion of patients in the magnesium group compared with the diltiazem group [13 of 23 patients, (57%), versus five of 23 patients, (22%), P=0.03].\\ Magnesium sulfate favorably affects rate control and seems to promote the conversion of long lasting episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm, representing a safe, reliable and cost-effective alternative treatment strategy to diltiazem.}

The transplant recipients were divided into those not taking nifedipine and those taking nifedipine. Cryostat sections were stained with monoclonal antibody for Ki-67, using an avidin-biotin-enzyme complex method. The mitotic activities of epithelial cells were determined as percentages of Ki-67 labeled cells in relation to total numbers of epithelial cells in the basal layer of oral, oral sulcular, and sulcular epithelium.\\ Mitotic activities were significantly higher in all 3 medication groups in the oral epithelium (P < or =0.003), and in the immunosuppression group in the sulcular epithelium (P= 0.032) than in the controls. In the oral sulcular epithelium, mitotic activity was fairly similar in all medication groups. In the nifedipine group a significant negative correlation was found between duration of nifedipine medication and the percentage of Ki-67 labeled cells in the oral epithelium (P= 0.025).\\ The results suggest that the increased epithelial thickness observed in nifedipine- and cyclosporin A-induced gingival overgrowth is associated with increased mitotic activity, especially in the oral epithelium.}

In this study, we evaluated whether there were differences in macrophages and lymphocyte subpopulations in human nifedipine- and CsA-associated gingival overgrowth as compared with those in normal gingiva.\\ Biopsy samples of overgrown gingiva were obtained from 9 nifedipine-treated cardiac outpatients, 13 CsA-treated renal transplant recipients including 9 patients who were also receiving nifedipine, and 30 healthy control individuals undergoing dental treatment. Serial 5 microm thick cryostat sections were stained with mAbs for CD20 (B-pan), CD68 (macrophages), CD4 (T-helper/inducer), and CD8 (T-cytotoxic/suppressor) using an avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex method. Numbers of mAb-labeled and all nucleated cells were determined in 3 areas: the connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium, the middle connective tissue, and the connective tissue beneath the oral epithelium. Distributions of each type of cell were expressed as percentages of mAb-labeled cells in relation to total number of nucleated cells in a counting zone. Significances of differences between groups were tested by means of the Kruskal-Wallis test, and between pairs of results by means of the Mann-Whitney U-test.\\ The proportion of CD8-labeled cells was significantly higher in connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium in the nifedipine group than in the controls (P = 0.014). In both medicated groups, the proportions of CD68-labeled cells were higher in all counting zones than in the controls, but statistically significantly only in the nifedipine group in the connective tissue beneath the oral epithelium (P = 0.008). No intergroup differences were found with respect to CD4- and CD20-labeled cells. The CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower in connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium in the nifedipine group than in the controls (P= 0.013).\\ The results support the idea that immune response may be altered in drug-induced gingival overgrowth.}

   Abstract={In recent years in conjunction with medicamentous treatment of renoparenchymatous hypertension in particular two problems were discussed: target blood pressure values and renoprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs. Prospective studies revealed that a blood pressure reading of < 130/80 mm Hg significantly retards the progression of nephropathy whereby patients with proteinuria > 1 g/d benefit from even lower BP readings. In diabetic nephropathy the drugs of choice are inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI), already in the incipient stage and also in normotensive patients. The importance of ACEI in the treatment of non-diabetic nephropathies was confirmed recently by controlled prospective studies AIPRI and REIN. A maximal renoprotective effect of ACEI probably calls for larger doses than those needed for normalization of BP. Long-term investigations of the renoprotective effect of antagonists of angiotensin AT1 receptors and comparative studies with ACEI resp. are not available. Dihydropyridine blockers of calcium channels with a short-term action (nifedipine) may have a negative influence on the progression of diabetic nephropathy, the effect of dihydropyridines of the second generation is tested in prospective studies. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have a renoprotective action in diabetic nephropathy. In cca two thirds of the patients combined treatment with ACEI and diuretics or with calcium channel blockers is necessary. As to other antihypertensive drugs, vasodilatating beta-blockers and perspectively antagonists of endothelin receptors are useful.}

   Abstract={Two multicentre trials have investigated the efficacy and tolerability of treatment with once-daily barnidipine, in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The long-term efficacy and safety of barnidipine were demonstrated in a long-term, multicentre, open-label study. In total, 106, 79 and 32 patients were followed for the first, second and third year, respectively. Patients received barnidipine at a dose titrated to achieve a sitting DBP > or = 90 mmHg or a decrease in sitting BDP > or = 10 mmHg. If necessary, another antihypertensive agent was added to achieve normalisation of blood pressure. In the first year, normalisation of blood pressure was achieved in 91% of patients. This was maintained in 91% and 81% of patients in the second and third years, respectively. At the end of treatment in both years, over 60% of patients remained on barnidipine monotherapy (10 or 20 mg/day). A low incidence of adverse events possibly or probably related to barnidipine (10 or 20 mg/day) monotherapy was reported in the first and second years with headache, peripheral oedema and palpitations the most commonly reported. In the third year of follow-up, only one adverse event, an ECG abnormality, was considered to be possibly related to the study medication. The effective 24 hour control of blood pressure with barnidipine monotherapy was confirmed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 20 patients. These patients were given 6 week regimens of both barnidipine (20 mg/day) and placebo. Office and 24 hour ambulatory blood pressures were recorded at the end of each treatment phase. Barnidipine lowered blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than placebo both at night and during the day. Adverse events were classified as mild or moderate and fewer adverse events were reported with barnidipine treatment compared with placebo. Barnidipine monotherapy (20 mg/day) is safe and effective in providing 24 hour control of blood pressure. Furthermore, the efficacy and tolerability of barnidipine monotherapy (10 or 20 mg/day) are maintained for at least 2 years.}

   Abstract={Vatanidipine is a novel dihydropyridine (DHP)-type calcium channel blocker with slow-onset pharmacological actions, which are probably due to both its slow uptake into vascular tissues and resistance in its approach to the calcium channel binding site. Vatanidipine once incorporated into vascular tissues is not easily released, even by repeated washing, thus resulting in a long-lasting action of the agent. A slow-onset and long-lasting hypotensive action was observed in various experimental hypertensive models. Clinical trials using human subjects with essential hypertension indicated that vatanidipine exerts an antihypertensive effect with a slow onset and long duration. In spite of its potent hypotensive effect, the incidence of adverse effects by vatanidipine administration has been reported to be lower than that in cases of nitrendipine. In addition to its vasodilatory effects, vatanidipine efficiently suppressed noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve endings, thus suggesting this agent exhibits a beneficial effect in the treatment of hypertensive patients, in which the reflex activation of peripheral sympathetic nerves is unfavourable to antihypertensive therapy. In a double-blind study, vatanidipine did not show reflex tachycardia, despite producing a potent and long-lasting hypotensive effect, in contrast to the administration of nitrendipine. In an animal study, vatanidipine exhibited a protective effect against cerebrovascular lesions, through a mechanism independent of its hypotensive effect. In addition, a renoprotective effect was also observed in experimental hypertensive models. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, vatanidipine exerted an anti-atherosclerotic action, which is probably attributable to the inhibitory action of the agent on low-density lipoprotein oxidation. In essential hypertensive patients, the plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride decreased after vatanidipine treatment, thus suggesting that this agent may have a therapeutic potential in preventing such vascular diseases as atherosclerosis. Taken together, vatanidipine appears to be a novel and useful antihypertensive agent, which can both prevent target-organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.}

   Abstract={The relative importance of hypertension in the progression of renal failure is well understood. Recently, several studies have provided evidence that antihypertensive therapy enhances renal survival. However, the specific antihypertensive drug regimens that are most effective in generating such long-term effects remain controversial.\\ Forty-nine hypertensive IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients (39 +/- 7 years old, serum creatinine 1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl) with proteinuria received antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi: 2.5-10 mg of benazapril daily) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs: 2.5-10 mg amlodipine daily) for 3 years. The patients' blood pressures in group one were controlled below 140/85 mmHg by increases in their first drug dose or by addition of the second drug in group 1. Blood pressures for patients in group 2 were controlled using the same two options, except to levels below 130/70 mmHg. Patients within the two groups were selected and controlled with regard to sex, age, and serum creatinine. The renal protective effects of each protocol were evaluated in terms of reductions in creatinine clearance. After 3 years of the above outlined blood pressure control regimens, the reductions in creatinine clearance were compared.\\ Creatinine clearances decreased in group 1 patients (from 85.7 +/- 2.4 ml/min to 72.9 +/- 2.4 ml/min, p < 0.05). On the other hand, creatinine clearance remained essentially unchanged for patients in group 2 (from 87.2 +/-4.7 ml/min to 85.9 +/- 5.9 ml/min). Although creatinine clearance in both groups was almost the same at the start of study, there was a significant difference between them by the conclusion of the study (p < 0.05). Proteinuria and hematuria did not change significantly throughout the study and there were no significant differences in these respects between these two corresponding groups. There were no significant differences between the groups with reference to side-effects or complications.\\ These data provide evidence that reducing blood pressure has protective renal effects in cases of mild renal insufficiency with hypertension in IgA nephropathy.}

   Volume="54",

   Abstract={Beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are both effective monotherapy for stable angina. When symptoms persist, these two agents are commonly co-prescribed in the hope that this combination has added benefit compared with monotherapy alone. We investigated the additional efficacy of the calcium antagonists amlodipine and nifedipine when added to bisoprolol in patients with stable angina. Patients were randomised in a multicentre, single-blind study, with crossover of three treatments consisting of bisoprolol 10 mg once daily, bisoprolol plus nifedipine 20 mg twice daily, and bisoprolol plus amlodipine 5 mg once daily. Exercise tests were performed at the end of each four-week study period and the exercise time to onset of angina was assessed. A total of 198 patients from 17 centres were recruited of whom 147 were evaluable for efficacy. There were no statistically significant differences in exercise duration to onset of angina between any of the groups. The combination of bisoprolol plus nifedipine was least well tolerated. In summary, this study suggests there is little benefit in adding a calcium antagonist to bisoprolol in treating patients with stable angina.}

   Abstract={To assess drug prescription patterns and medical resource consumption in an elderly population in Quebec receiving amlodipine or felodipine for the treatment of hypertension.\\ Sociodemographic, clinical and drug claim data for a random sample of hypertensive patients 65 years of age and older with at least one claim for amlodipine or felodipine between August 1, 1990 and August 31, 1997 were extracted from the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) database. Patterns of prescription renewal, drug switch and compliance rates, and health care resource use were established for both an amlodipine and a felodipine group. Long term persistence on treatment was quantified by survival curve analysis.\\ The amlodipine (5188 patients) and felodipine (2630 patients) groups were similar in terms of sex ratio (66.7% female) and age (mean 74 years). Average compliance rates for amlodipine patients (67.9%) were significantly higher than for felodipine patients (66.2%) (P<0.01), and switch rates were 5.4-fold higher in the latter group. Patients initiating treatment with felodipine had a 27% increased rate of discontinuation (relative risk 1.27) compared with the amlodipine patients. In addition, patients with at least one year of follow-up data were more likely to maintain amlodipine as part of their antihypertensive regimens than felodipine. After adjustment, medical resource consumption patterns were similar for both groups except for an increase in the number of specialist visits for the amlodipine treatment group.\\ Patients who received amlodipine, either as a monotherapy or as part of a multitherapy regimen, were more compliant and persistent with their treatment than patients on felodipine. The data suggest that amlodipine may provide more effective long term hypertension control than felodipine, and that the two drugs are not therapeutically equivalent.}

   Abstract={The main objective of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the long-term effect of the heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists verapamil and diltiazem on the incidence of combined cardiac events and all-cause mortality in patients who had experienced a non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but who did not also have pulmonary congestion. In addition, factors having an independent association with these 2 outcomes were identified. Of 817 non-Q-wave patients, 81 (9.9%) died during 12 to 52 months of follow-up. The unadjusted mortality rate was 42% lower in patients randomized to calcium antagonist therapy than placebo (7.2% vs 12.4%, p = 0.010). Non-Q-wave patients who died during follow-up were older than patients who survived (62 vs 58 years, p = 0.001). Other factors found to have an independent association with all-cause mortality included diuretic use (RR 2.79), diabetes mellitus (RR 2.86), and New York Heart Association class >I (RR 1.73). The covariate adjusted all-cause mortality risk ratio associated with randomization to calcium antagonist therapy was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [0.40 to 1.05, p = 0.079]). Overall, 153 patients (18.7%) died or had nonfatal reinfarction. The unadjusted combined event rate was 31% lower in patients randomized to calcium antagonist therapy than to placebo (15.2% vs 21.9%, p <0.006). Factors found to have an independent association with cardiac events included age, diabetes (RR 2.82), diuretic use (RR 2.04), and previous AMI (RR 1. 71). In addition, randomization to the calcium antagonist group had a significant independent association with reduced cardiac events (p = 0.031). The covariate adjusted event rate RR associated with randomization to the calcium antagonist group was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [0.49 to 0.97]). In conclusion, the heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists diltiazem and verapamil may play an important role in reducing long-term mortality and reinfarction in non-Q-wave AMI without pulmonary congestion.}

The two treatment groups were similar with respect to all pretreatment characteristics. Patients were seen on an outpatient basis for recording of resting electrocardiogram (ECG) after one week, one, three and six months of follow-up or whenever they felt that they had a relapse into atrial fibrillation or experienced an adverse event.\\ In the metoprolol CR/XL group, 96 patients (48.7%) had a relapse into atrial fibrillation compared with 118 patients (59.9%) in the placebo group (p = 0.005). Heart rate in patients after a relapse into atrial fibrillation was significantly lower in the metoprolol group (98 +/- 23 beats/min) than in the placebo group (107 +/- 27 beats/min). The rate of adverse events reported was similar in both groups when the difference in follow-up time was taken into account.\\ The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients after cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation showed that metoprolol CR/XL was effective in preventing relapse into atrial fibrillation or flutter.}

   Abstract={This is a summary of reports of presentation made at the American College of Cardiology 49th Scientific Sessions, Anaheim, 12-15 March 2000. Studies with a particular interest for heart failure physicians have been reviewed. OPTIME-CHF: Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure. OPTIME-CHF was a randomised-controlled trial comparing a 48-h infusion of Milrinone or standard therapy in 951 patients recruited over a 2-year period. Patients were excluded if the investigator believed their clinical condition mandated inotropic therapy. Patients were randomised within 48 h of admission for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure to receive Milrinone or placebo infision for 48 h. Of the patients 43% were diabetics, 70% were receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, 25% were already on a beta-Blocker, and 34% had atrial fibrillation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay during the index admission, subsequent readmissions and days in hospital over the following 60 days. Subjective clinical assessment scores were also no different. There was an average admission rate over the next year of one per patient in both groups. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of sustained hypotension in the Milrinone group, which accounted for all of the increased adverse event rates for the active therapy. The 60-day mortality was 10% in both groups. This and previous trials of the oral formulation of Milrinone have now clearly demonstrated a lack of benefit with Milrinone in either during acute exacerbations of or in stable severe chronic heart failure [Packer M, Carver JR, Rodeheffer RJ et al. Effect of oral Milrinone on mortality in severe chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1991;325:1468-1475.]. Medium sized studies of Milrinone in patients with milder severities of heart failure also suggested an adverse impact on prognosis in the presence or absence of digoxin [DiBianco R, Shabetai R, Kostuk W, Moran J, Schlant RC, Wright R. A comparison of oral Milrinone, digoxin, and their combination in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. N Engl J Med 1989;320:677-683.]. Whether Milrinone even has a role for the management of a haemodyamic crisis requiring inotropic therapy must also be questioned.}

   Abstract={Adverse events during drug therapy can be assessed through measurement of 2 features: their frequency and their severity. Their severity, in turn, can be measured by assessing the distress that they cause. Our goal was to relate the magnitude of the distress induced by treatment with calcium-channel blocking agents to the change in quality of life assessed through psychosocial instruments in patients treated with calcium-channel blocking agents, either for hypertension or for angina pectoris.\\ Four hundred seventy-five patients with angina pectoris were randomized to double-blind treatment with PPR (physiological pattern release) verapamil hydrochloride, amlodipine besylate, amlodipineatenolol combination, or placebo. In addition, 557 hypertensive patients were randomized either to PPR verapamil or nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal system). Both studies were double-blind.\\ Significant differences in treatment of angina pectoris or hypertension, were not found between the regimens. Overall quality of life also failed to show a significant difference in either group. In both groups, however, remarkable concordance was found between the degree of distress associated with specific symptoms and a change in quality of life. An unchanged, stable symptom distress was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of life of about 0.1 SD. Improvement or erosion of symptom distress represented by 1 step was associated with a 0.1- to 0.2-SD change. The extreme change in symptom distress was associated with a substantially larger change in global quality of life.\\ The magnitude of symptom distress or relief associated with symptoms in 2 patient populations correlated strongly with a shift in quality of life. The assessment of distress associated with symptoms provides valuable additional information on drug therapy.}

The latter randomised trial showed in a similar population that the cardiovascular protection of more recent antihypertensive agents such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors is similar to that of the conventional antihypertensive drugs used in the first study. In fact, the degree of blood pressure control appears to be more important than the type of antihypertensive drugs used, and this conclusion is reinforced by the observation that numerous patients should rapidly be treated by more than one antihypertensive agent to reach blood pressure targets.}

   Abstract={As melatonin has been found to play a role in the mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation, we designed the present study to evaluate whether the evening ingestion of the pineal hormone might interfere with the antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive patients well-controlled by nifedipine monotherapy.\\ Forty-seven mild to moderate essential hypertensive outpatients taking nifedipine GITS 30 or 60 mg monotherapy at 08.30 h for at least 3 months, were given placebo or melatonin 5 mg at 22.30 h for 4 weeks according to a double-blind cross-over study. At the end of each treatment period patients underwent a 24 h noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) during usual working days; sleeping period was scheduled to last from 23.00 to 07.00 h.\\ The evening administration of melatonin induced an increase of blood pressure and heart rate throughout the 24 h period (DeltaSBP = + 6.5 mmHg, P < 0.001; DeltaDBP = + 4.9 mmHg, P < 0.01; DeltaHR = + 3.9 beats min-1, P < 0.01). The DBP as well as the HR increase were particularly evident during the morning and the afternoon hours.\\ We hypothesize that competition between melatonin and nifedipine, is able to impair the antihypertensive efficacy of the calcium channel blocker. This suggests caution in uncontrolled use of melatonin in hypertensive patients. As the pineal hormone might interfere with calcium channel blocker therapy, it cannot be considered simply a dietary supplement.}

   Abstract={Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) can be effectively terminated by the intravenous administration of adenosine or verapamil. However adenosine is expensive and injectable verapamil currently is scarcely available. While intravenous diltiazem has been shown to be useful for terminating PSVT, the efficacy of esmolol in this regard has not been evaluated previously. Hence these latter two drugs were studied for their efficacy in terminating PSVT.\\ A prospective, randomised, crossover study was undertaken in patients presenting with hemodynamically tolerated PSVT to the ICCU. While 50 patients had been planned for the trial, the study had to be prematurely terminated after 32 patients had been enrolled due to the marked superiority of diltiazem. Two sequential doses with a 5 minute interval of either drug were administered before crossover. Diltiazem was given in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg while the esmolol dose was 0.5 mg/kg.\\ Diltiazem terminated PSVT in all the 16 patients in whom it was given as the first drug. The 12 patients who did not respond to esmolol were also effectively treated with diltiazem. Thus totally 28/28 patients responded to diltiazem while only 4/16 patients responded to esmolol (p < 0.001). Of the 28 patients who responded to diltiazem, in 13 patients the second bolus of diltiazem worked after the first one had failed. No significant adverse effects were seen.\\ Intravenous diltiazem is highly effective and safe for terminating PSVT. When the first bolus is ineffective, the second bolus given after 5 minutes usually succeeds. Esmolol in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg has poor efficacy for terminating PSVT, even when 2 boluses are administered.}

   Abstract={In a prospective open multicentric study two groups (A and B) of patients with essential hypertension used different methods for blood pressure measurements under treatment with the calcium channel blocker nifidipine GITS 30 and 60 mg. Fifty-one patients were followed for 6 weeks. Results of 24 hour blood pressure monitoring at visits after 2, 4 and 6 weeks were only known to physicians of group A. In this group the patients took their blood pressure twice per day.\\ Both methods for measurement showed an overall decrease of blood pressure in the course of therapy. The mean values at the medical visits were always higher than the average measurements by 24 hour monitoring or the self assessment of blood pressure. The latter two blood pressure values tended to agree favorably. The differences between measurements during medical visits and measurements taken at home or during normal activity show that measurements in the doctor's office may lead to overestimation of hypertension. Without the results from blood pressure monitoring 4 (22%) of the patients in group B were treated without reason. Nifedipine GITS was well tolerated. Nine patients (16%) had undesired drug effects leading to a premature halt of treatment in 3 of them.}

Two-hundred and one patients with Canadian Cardiovascular Society class II to III angina who were on 50 mg of atenolol yet still experiencing angina symptoms were randomized to receive either placebo or nifedipine GITS 30, 60 or 90 mg/day. After four weeks of treatment, the changes in time from baseline to onset of 1 mm ST segment depression in the 183 eligible patients were 26.7+/-10.2 s, 40.9+/-11.3 s, 63.2+/-12.9 s and 70.3+/-12.6 for the placebo, and 30, 60 and 90 mg/day groups, respectively. These differences were significant (P<0.05) for the 60 and 90 mg/day groups compared with placebo and for the 60 mg/day group compared with the 30 mg/day group. The times to onset of pain and termination of exercise showed similar prolongation but did not achieve statistical significance. During the one-year open label phase of the study, patients exhibited statistically significant improvements in the time to onset of ST segment depression, time to anginal pain and time to termination of exercise at a mean dose of 52.3 mg/day of nifedipine GITS. Adverse events were primarily vasodilatory in nature. This study supports the use of nifedipine GITS in patients with chronic stable angina inadequately controlled on beta-blocker alone.}

This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of combined diltiazem and lidocaine with each drug alone in suppressing the hemodynamic changes during tracheal extubation.\\ Sixty hypertensive patients (ASA II), defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg (WHO), undergoing elective orthopedic surgery received, in a randomized, double-blind manner, 0.2 mg x kg(-1) diltiazem, 1.0 mg x kg(-1) lidocaine, or 0.2 mg x kg(-1) diltiazem plus 1.0 mg x kg(-1) lidocaine (n=20 of each) i.v. before tracheal extubation. Changes in heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and rate-pressure product (RPP) were measured before and after tracheal extubation.\\ Hemodynamic changes during tracheal extubation were less in patients receiving diltiazem plus lidocaine than in those receiving diltiazem or lidocaine as a sole medicine (RPP; 10322 +/- 1674 (combined) vs 11532 +/- 1802 (diltiazem), 15388 +/- 2050 (lidocaine), mean +/- SD, P < 0.05).\\ Combined diltiazem and lidocaine is more effective prophylaxis than diltiazem or lidocaine alone for attenuating the cardiovascular responses to tracheal extubation and emergence from anesthesia in hypertensive patients.}

   Abstract={In the present study we analysed registered adverse drug reactions caused by 19 most used drugs in Bulgaria during three-year period. The cases were assembled from the spontaneous reporting system operated in our country. We described demographic characteristics of the patients, clinical diagnosis and reporting rates per 100,000 inhabitants for each drug. The data for antibiotics were compared with the results of our previous research. We analysed 188 adverse drug reactions i.e. 21% of all reports received in the Centre for Drug Safety of the National Drug Institute. Adverse drug reactions type B such as oedema, allergy, coma, etc. predominate. The number of cases with perforated ulcer and melaena caused by acetylsalicylic acid is considerable. The frequency of adverse drug reaction for the investigated drugs in "rare" according to WHO standards. It is necessary to assemble more information on adverse drug reactions and every serious case and inform medical doctors and pharmacists as a first step for improving the pharmacovigilance system in Bulgaria.}

   Abstract={The aim of the HOT Study (Hypertension Optimal Treatment) was to determine the optimal diastolic blood pressure decrease and to assess the effect of the acetyl salicylic acid as a primary prevention on the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. The HOT Study is an open, prospective, randomised, international trial with blinded end points. This study included 18,790 patients, 50 to 80 years old (mean 61.5 years) in 26 countries (1,574 patients in France) with a primary hypertension (100 < or = PAD < or = 115 mmHg). The patients were randomised in 3 target diastolic blood pressure: < or = 80 mmHg (n = 6,262), < or = 85 mmHg (n = 6,264), < or = 90 mmHg (n = 6,264). The felodipine LP, a long acting dihydropyridine, was selected as a first line therapy, other hypertension drugs combined if necessary. The lowest incidence of cardiovascular events was observed at a diastolic blood pressure level of 82.6 mmHg. There was no increased risk below this level even in the hypertensive patients with medical history of coronary heart disease or stroke. In the diabetic population, the diastolic blood pressure decrease from 90 to 80 reduced the incidence of the major cardiovascular events by 51%. The acetyl salicylic acid reduced the myocardial infarction risk in the blood pressure well-controlled population.}

   Abstract={The purpose of this study was to compare the distribution of Langerhans' cells in normal human gingiva and in nifedipine- and immunosuppressive medication-induced gingival overgrowth by means of an immunohistochemical study.\\ Gingival samples were collected from 11 nifedipine-medicated cardiac patients, 22 triple-medicated (azathioprine, prednisolone, and cyclosporin A) renal transplant recipients, and 28 generally healthy individuals. Patients were grouped into the immunosuppression group, the combined immunosuppression and nifedipine group, the nifedipine group, and the generally healthy control group. Five microm-thick cryostat sections were stained with monoclonal antibody (mAb) for CD1a using an avidin-biotin-enzyme complex (ABC) method. Numbers of CD1a-labeled cells/mm2 were determined in 6 areas: oral epithelium, oral sulcular epithelium, sulcular epithelium, middle connective tissue, connective tissue beneath the oral epithelium, and connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium. Significances of differences between the groups were tested by means of the Kruskall-Wallis test, and significances of differences between pairs of results by the Mann-Whitney U-test and the t test.\\ Numbers of CD1a-labeled cells were significantly lower in the medicated groups than in controls in all 3 epithelial areas (P <0.0001) and in the connective tissue beneath the sulcular epithelium (P <0.0021). There were significantly fewer CD1a-labeled cells in the sulcular epithelium in the nifedipine group than in the other medication groups.\\ The reduced numbers of CD1a-labeled cells found in nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth were similar to the reduced numbers of CD1a-labeled cells in gingival overgrowth associated with immunosuppressive medication.}

In this study 18,790 patients with diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 115 mmHg were randomly assigned target pressures of < or = 90, < or = 85 and < or = 80 mmHg respectively, and treated with a felodipine-based antihypertensive regimen. In all three groups an impressive fall in both diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and as a consequence very few major cardiovascular events (the primary endpoint of the study) were observed, but there was no difference in endpoint scores among the three groups. Type 2 diabetic patients fared substantially better than non-diabetic patients and they are likely to profit if their diastolic pressure is decreased below 80 mmHg. In the remaining patients rigorous maintenance of present-day standards (diastolic pressure < or = 90 mmHg) is advised. The addition of 75 mg aspirin 1 dd resulted in a modest but significant reduction of major cardiovascular events, but at the cost of increased gastrointestinal bleedings.}

Studies were selected if they reported at least 1 of the following outcomes: cardiac death, myocardial infarction, study withdrawal due to adverse events, angina frequency, nitroglycerin use, or exercise duration. Ninety (63%) of 143 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.\\ Two independent reviewers extracted data from selected articles, settling any differences by consensus. Outcome data were extracted a third time by 1 of the investigators. We combined results using odds ratios (ORs) for discrete data and mean differences for continuous data. Studies of calcium antagonists were grouped by duration and type of drug (nifedipine vs nonnifedipine).\\ Rates of cardiac death and myocardial infarction were not significantly different for treatment with beta-blockers vs calcium antagonists (OR, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-1.38; P = .79). There were 0.31 (95% CI, 0.00-0.62; P = .05) fewer episodes of angina per week with beta-blockers than with calcium antagonists. beta-Blockers were discontinued because of adverse events less often than were calcium antagonists (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86; P<.001). The differences between beta-blockers and calcium antagonists were most striking for nifedipine (OR for adverse events with beta-blockers vs nifedipine, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.77). Too few trials compared nitrates with calcium antagonists or beta-blockers to draw firm conclusions about relative efficacy.\\ beta-Blockers provide similar clinical outcomes and are associated with fewer adverse events than calcium antagonists in randomized trials of patients who have stable angina.}

To determine the frequency of spontaneous recognition of these ADRs by the attending physicians and to assess the potential value of ALS for detection of ADRs.\\ Laboratory results of patients hospitalised in a nine bed medical ward were automatically recorded over a period of 17 months. Values exceeding defined boundaries were used as ALS. Charts of every third patient were analysed retrospectively with regard to adverse drug related reactions and causality was evaluated as well as whether the ADR had been recognised during the period of hospitalisation.\\ The charts and ALS of 98 patients were analysed. In 18 cases a drug-related adverse reaction was probable. Awareness to the reaction by the treating physicians was evident in 6 out of these 18 ADRs. Approximately 80% of the ADRs were considered predictable. Three ADRs were regarded as serious.\\ Adverse drug reactions are common and often preventable. Only one third of ADRs which could have been detected through ALS were recognised by the attending physicians. An increased doctor's awareness of the frequency of drug related abnormal laboratory results by means of ALS is likely to increase the recognition rate of ADRs and might help to prevent them.}

   Abstract={Erectile dysfunction and impotence has a high prevalence among male hypertensive patients. Whether this relates mainly to specific drug side effects or to primary pathogenic disorders is unknown. In the present study 101 male patients from our outpatient hypertension clinic answered detailed questionnaires about hypertension and sexual function. Patients with perceived impotence were offered a thorough penile evaluation and examination performed by specialists in the urology department. Twenty-seven (27%) men had impotence. The main cause of impotence was an arterial dysfunction (89%). The prevalence of impotence was related to the degree of secondary organ manifestation, reflected by World Health Organization (WHO) classification I-III (P = .01). Intermittent claudication (P = .001) and ischemic heart disease (P = .005) were the best determinants in this respect. Twelve impotent patients (44%) ascribed onset of impotence to drug initiation. A variety of drugs were incriminated in the occurrence of drug-induced impotence. In summary our results indicate that impotence in hypertensive men is caused mainly by penile arterial vascular changes, probably atherosclerosis. Drug-induced impotence could well be the result of blood pressure reduction itself and not specific drug side effects.}

   Abstract={Recent reports suggest that calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes and hypertension. We previously reported that antihypertensive treatment with the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. In this post hoc analysis, we compared the outcome of treatment with nitrendipine in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.\\ After stratification according to center, sex, and presence or absence of previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients (age, > or =60 years) with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic pressure below 95 mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg per day) with the possible addition or substitution of enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg per day) or both, titrated to reduce the systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg and to less than 150 mm Hg. In the control group, matching placebo tablets were administered similarly.\\ At randomization, 492 patients (10.5 percent) had diabetes. After a median follow-up of two years, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the placebo and active-treatment groups differed by 8.6 and 3.9 mm Hg, respectively, among the diabetic patients. Among the 4203 patients without diabetes, systolic and diastolic pressures differed by 10.3 and 4.5 mm Hg, respectively, in the two groups. After adjustment for possible confounders, active treatment was found to have reduced overall mortality by 55 percent (from 45.1 deaths per 1000 patients to 26.4 deaths per 1000 patients), mortality from cardiovascular disease by 76 percent, all cardiovascular events combined by 69 percent, fatal and nonfatal strokes by 73 percent, and all cardiac events combined by 63 percent in the group of patients with diabetes. Among the nondiabetic patients, active treatment decreased all cardiovascular events combined by 26 percent and fatal and nonfatal strokes by 38 percent. In the group of patients receiving active treatment, reductions in overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and all cardiovascular events were significantly larger among the diabetic patients than among the nondiabetic patients (P=0.04, P=0.02, and P=0.01, respectively).\\ Nitrendipine-based antihypertensive therapy is particularly beneficial in older patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. Thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the use of long-acting calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in diabetic patients.}

   Abstract={Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure, despite the lack of data from randomised intervention trials to show that such treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomised intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension.\\ CAPPP was a prospective, randomised, open trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths.\\ Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044).\\ Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients randomised to conventional therapy.}

After 8 weeks+/-1 week taking Nif-CC, they were again monitored with a 24-hour blood pressure monitor. The 24-hour blood pressure load (percentage of values > 135/85 mm Hg for 24 hrs), daytime blood pressure load (percentage of values > 140/90 mm Hg from 7:00 A.M.-10:00 P.M.), nighttime blood pressure load (percentage of values > 120/80 mm Hg from 10:00 P.M.-7:00 A.M.), diurnal blood pressure variation, average 24-hour blood pressure, daytime blood pressure, nighttime blood pressure, mean blood pressure for the first 4 hours, and last 8 hours of the dosing interval were measured. Adverse effects such as headache, dizziness, and edema were also reported.\\ No differences in average 24 hour-blood pressure readings were observed but significant differences in blood pressure control during the first 4 and last 8 hours of the dosing interval were seen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher after approximately 16 hours in patients switched from Nif-GITS to Nif-CC. Although Nif-CC caused a greater initial response, it was less effective than Nif-GITS after 16 hours. This could explain the lack of differences in average 24-hour blood pressure values between formulations. Of the 20 patients, 20% experienced increased headaches, 20% showed signs of increased peripheral edema, and 10% reported occasional dizziness after switching agents. Three patients discontinued Nif-CC, two as ordered by their primary care physician and one on his own due to headache.\\ This study suggests that patients switched from Nif-GITS to Nif-CC could experience increased blood pressure during the night or toward the end of the dosing interval. They could also experience adverse effects such as headache, edema, and dizziness, which could result in more physician visits and put patients with other disease states such as coronary heart disease at increased risk.}

   Abstract={Postoperative supraventricular tachyarrhythmia is a common complication of surgery. Because chemical cardioversion is often ineffective, ventricular rate control remains a principal goal of therapy. The authors hypothesized that patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia after major noncardiac surgery who receive intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade for ventricular rate control would experience conversion to sinus rhythm at a rate that differs from those receiving intravenous calcium channel blockade.\\ The rate of conversion to sinus rhythm at 2 and 12 h after treatment was examined in 64 cases of postoperative supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. After adenosine administration, patients who remained in supraventricular tachyarrhythmia were prospectively randomized to receive either intravenous diltiazem or intravenous esmolol for ventricular rate control (unblinded). Loading and infusion rates were adjusted to achieve equivalent degrees of ventricular rate control.\\ Patients were similar with regard to age and Apache III score. Most patients in both groups had atrial fibrillation (esmolol, 79%; diltiazem, 81%), and none experienced stable conversion with adenosine. Patients randomized to receive esmolol experienced a 59% rate of conversion to sinus rhythm within 2 h of treatment, compared with only 33% for patients randomized to receive diltiazem (intention to treat, P = 0.049; odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.046 to 7.8). After 12 h of therapy, the number of patients converting to sinus rhythm increased in both groups (esmolol, 85%; diltiazem, 62%), and the rates of conversion no longer differed significantly. Ventricular rates when supraventricular tachyarrhythmia began and after 2 and 12 h of rate control therapy were similar in the two treatment groups. The in-hospital mortality rate and length of stay in the intensive care unit were not significantly influenced by treatment group.\\ Among adenosine-resistant patients in the intensive care unit with atrial fibrillation after noncardiac surgery, intravenous esmolol produced a more rapid (2-h) conversion to sinus rhythm than did intravenous diltiazem.}

Whether this approach is superior to intensive treatment with anti-ischemic medications is unknown.\\ We performed a prospective, randomized pilot study comparing intensive medical therapy with coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for suppression of myocardial ischemia in 44 stable survivors of AMI. Myocardial ischemia was quantified with adenosine 201Tl tomography (SPECT) performed 4.5+/-2.9 days after AMI. All patients at baseline had a large total (>/=20%) and ischemic (>/=10%) left ventricular perfusion defect size (PDS). SPECT was repeated at 43+/-26 days after therapy was optimized. The total stress-induced PDS was comparably reduced with medical therapy (from 38+/-13% to 26+/-16%; P<0.0001) and PTCA (from 35+/-12% to 20+/-16%; P<0.0001). The reduction in ischemic PDS was also similar (P=NS) in both groups. Cardiac events occurred in 7 of 44 patients over 12+/-5 months. Patients who remained clinically stable had a greater reduction in ischemic PDS (-13+/-9%) than those who had a recurrent cardiac event (-5+/-7%; P<0.02). Event-free survival was superior in the 24 patients who had a significant (>/=9%) reduction in PDS (96%) compared with those who did not (65%; P=0.009).\\ In this small pilot study, intensive medical therapy and PTCA were comparable at suppressing ischemia in stable patients after AMI. Sequential imaging with adenosine SPECT can track changes in PDS after anti-ischemic therapies and thereby predict subsequent outcome. Corroboration of these preliminary findings in a larger cardiac-event trial is warranted.}

   Abstract={A matched-pair case-control analysis of Medicaid claims was performed to determine the risks of hospitalization associated with drug-drug interactions. Patients were hospitalized and controls were not. They were randomly matched based on contemporaneous eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Odds ratios for hospitalization in patients exposed to known drug-drug interactions were compared with those in patients exposed to one of the interacting agents. When confidence intervals did not overlap, the odds ratio was considered to be significantly increased. Odds ratios were significantly increased for many interacting drug pairs, and were associated with commonly recognized interactions as well as less widely recognized ones. Cimetidine interactions achieved significance only with theophylline. In the Medicaid population, exposure to a number of drug-drug interactions was associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization.}

   Abstract={In a double-blind randomized trial in unstable angina it was shown that intravenous diltiazem reduced ischaemic events in the first 48 h after inclusion better than intravenous nitroglycerin. The present study was performed to establish the long-term prognosis of the randomized patients, with respect to their initial treatment assignment.\\ One year follow-up data on ischaemic end-points and anti-ischaemic medication were recorded. Results were available for all of the 121 randomized patients. One hundred and sixty-seven primary endpoint events were recorded, of which 54 occurred in the first 48 h and 113 during the follow-up. Survival analysis showed that event-free survival was significantly better in the diltiazem group (45.0%) than in the nitroglycerin group (34.4%), P=0.04. The incidence rate after 48 h and one year for cardiac death are, respectively, 0% and 4.1%. The trend in anti-ischaemic medication was higher in the nitroglycerin group. For beta-blockers, this trend became significant after 12 months (P=0.03).\\ These results show that the initial benefit obtained by early treatment with intravenous diltiazem was preserved during the first year after the initial hospitalization, and that, despite the high risk of cardiac events in our population, the overall mortality 12 months after inclusion was low.}

More patients in the captopril group than the atenolol group took the allocated treatment: at their last clinic visit, 78% of those allocated captopril and 65% of those allocated atenolol were taking the drug (P<0.0001). Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing the risk of macrovascular end points. Similar proportions of patients in the two groups showed deterioration in retinopathy by two grades after nine years (31% in the captopril group and 37% in the atenolol group) and developed clinical grade albuminuria >=300 mg/l (5% and 9%). The proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic attacks was not different between groups, but mean weight gain in the atenolol group was greater (3.4 kg v 1.6 kg).\\ Blood pressure lowering with captopril or atenolol was similarly effective in reducing the incidence of diabetic complications. This study provided no evidence that either drug has any specific beneficial or deleterious effect, suggesting that blood pressure reduction in itself may be more important than the treatment used.}

Equally high blood pressure without symptoms is called a hypertensive crisis. Patients with hypertensive crisis or emergency need prompt, effective, and specific therapy and a controlled reduction of blood pressure.\\ We performed a randomized, double-blind multi-centre study, to compare the safety, efficacy and tolerability of an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of two dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (either nifedipine or felodipine) in 122 patients, of whom 63 were diagnosed as hypertensive emergencies and 59 as hypertensive crisis, who had not reacted adequately (diastolic blood pressure <115 mmHg) to 5 mg of nifedipine PO.\\ Both drugs lowered blood pressure adequately in more than 90% of the patients and were well tolerated. Only one patient had to be withdrawn, because of an excessive decrease in blood pressure.\\ Patients with excessively high blood pressure who do not react to oral nifedipine can be treated equally effectively with felodipine and nifedipine IV. Felodipine is easier to handle because of its lack of light sensitivity.}

   Abstract={Barnidipine is a new 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a strong and long-lasting vasodilatory effect. In order to assess the haemodynamic profile of the antihypertensive effect of barnidipine, a randomized, double-blind study of barnidipine vs nitrendipine was performed in 24 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Following an initial 4-week placebo period, patients whose sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) was between 95 and 114 mm Hg, and whose sitting systolic blood pressure was between 150 and 219 mm Hg, were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either barnidipine (10 mg) or nitrendipine (10 mg) once daily, for a 6-week double-blind period. Subsequently, patients with an SiDBP of less than 90 mm Hg continued for a second 6-week period with the same monotherapy, while patients with an SiDBP of 90 mm Hg or above received double the dose of antihypertensive treatment for the next 6 weeks. Two-dimensional M- and B-mode echocardiography with Doppler flowmetry was performed at the end of both the placebo and active treatment phases. Barnidipine and nitrendipine reduced blood pressure by the same degree (barnidipine: from 165 +/- 2/100 +/- 1 to 145 +/- 2/89 +/- 1 mm Hg, p < 0.01; nitrendipine: from 163 +/- 3/100 +/- 2 to 143 +/- 7/90 +/- 3 mm Hg, p < 0.01) as a result of peripheral vasodilation. This was not accompanied by reflex neurohormonal activation. Moreover, only in the group receiving barnidipine was a significant decrease in plasma noradrenaline observed, both when the patients were in the supine position (from 298 +/- 27 to 214 +/- 21 pg/ml, p < 0.05) and when they were upright (from 472 +/- 37 to 348 +/- 38 pg/ml, p < 0.05).}

   Abstract={Despite treatment, there is often a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with hypertension than in normotensive individuals. Inadequate reduction of their blood pressure is a likely cause, but the optimum target blood pressure is not known. The impact of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has never been investigated in patients with hypertension. We aimed to assess the optimum target diastolic blood pressure and the potential benefit of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid in the treatment of hypertension.\\ 18790 patients, from 26 countries, aged 50-80 years (mean 61.5 years) with hypertension and diastolic blood pressure between 100 mm Hg and 115 mm Hg (mean 105 mm Hg) were randomly assigned a target diastolic blood pressure. 6264 patients were allocated to the target pressure < or =90 mm Hg, 6264 to < or =85 mm Hg, and 6262 to < or =80 mm Hg. Felodipine was given as baseline therapy with the addition of other agents, according to a five-step regimen. In addition, 9399 patients were randomly assigned 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid (Bamycor, Astra) and 9391 patients were assigned placebo.\\ Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 20.3 mm Hg, 22.3 mm Hg, and 24.3 mm Hg, in the < or =90 mm Hg, < or =85 mm Hg, and < or =80 mm Hg target groups, respectively. The lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events occurred at a mean achieved diastolic blood pressure of 82.6 mm Hg; the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality occurred at 86.5 mm Hg. Further reduction below these blood pressures was safe. In patients with diabetes mellitus there was a 51% reduction in major cardiovascular events in target group < or =80 mm Hg compared with target group < or =90 mm Hg (p for trend=0.005). Acetylsalicylic acid reduced major cardiovascular events by 15% (p=0.03) and all myocardial infarction by 36% (p=0.002), with no effect on stroke. There were seven fatal bleeds in the acetylsalicylic acid group and eight in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major bleeds in the two groups, respectively (p<0.001).\\ Intensive lowering of blood pressure in patients with hypertension was associated with a low rate of cardiovascular events. The HOT Study shows the benefits of lowering the diastolic blood pressure down to 82.6 mm Hg. Acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced major cardiovascular events with the greatest benefit seen in all myocardial infarction. There was no effect on the incidence of stroke or fatal bleeds, but non-fatal major bleeds were twice as common.}

Prospectively defined analyses of data from comparative and noncomparative trials of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS were conducted. Outcome measures included cardiovascular and noncardiovascular deaths, and adverse cardiovascular events including new/worsened angina, myocardial infarction (MI), serious arrhythmia, stroke, congestive heart failure, and bleeding. Among all amlodipine-treated patients (n = 32,920), the incidence rates for all-cause death, MI, and new/worsened angina were 3.0, 3.3, and 1.6/1,000 patient-years of exposure, respectively. Among those in comparative trials alone (n = 4,126), the all-cause death rate was 4.1/1,000 patient-years, which was comparable to that of other non-CCB agents and significantly less than that of other CCBs (23.8/1,000 patient-years, p = 0.015), although the difference in rates represents only 2 deaths. Among all nifedipine-GITS-treated patients (n = 2,645), the rate of all-cause death was 4.1/1,000 patient-years, of MI 6.5/1,000 patient-years, and of new/ worsened angina 5.7/1,000 patient-years. The incidence rates for MI and other cardiac events were low in these hypertension trials, and did not differ among treatment groups in either the amlodipine or nifedipine GITS comparative analyses. In the clinical trial databases analyzed, there is no signal suggesting excessive risk of death or cardiovascular events for hypertensive patients treated with amlodipine or nifedipine GITS.}

After a washout period, patients who responded were crossed over to receive the other drug in a similar fashion (phase II).\\ At the end of each infusion, the patient's ejection fraction was assessed by gated angiography. Of the 17 men initially randomized, 8 successfully completed both phases I and II. In these patients, baseline mean (+/- SD) ventricular rates before treatment with intravenous diltiazem and verapamil were 138 +/- 15 and 132 +/- 9 beats/minute, respectively (NS). At 2 minutes after the initial bolus dose, the mean ventricular rate decreased to 100 +/- 13 beats/minute in the diltiazem group compared with 114 +/- 17 beats/minute in those receiving verapamil (p < 0.05). Mean ventricular rates of 96 +/- 11 and 97 +/- 9 beats/minute were maintained during the 8-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem and verapamil, respectively (NS). On completion of the bolus dose(s) and during continuous infusions, there were no significant differences in blood pressures between the groups. Mean ejection fractions were 35.6 +/- 13.6% and 35.5 +/- 15.4% in the diltiazem and verapamil groups, respectively (NS). For the 17 patients, the mean maximum percentage decreases in blood pressure were not significantly different between groups. However, three patients developed symptomatic hypotension, all of whom were randomized to receive verapamil initially.\\ Intravenous diltiazem and verapamil are comparable in terms of efficacy and effect on systolic function in patients with rapid atrial fibrillation and flutter. However, hypotension may limit therapy with verapamil in some patients.}

   Abstract={Relationships between apolipoproteins and other lipid parameters and cardiovascular (CV) prognosis were evaluated in the Angina Prognosis Study In Stockholm (APSIS). Out of 809 patients with stable angina pectoris, lipid variables were obtained in 786 patients at baseline, and after one month's double-blind treatment with metoprolol or verapamil, to evaluate treatment effects on these lipid variables. During a median follow-up time of 3.3 years (2663 patient years), 37 patients suffered a CV death, 30 suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and 100 underwent a revascularization. Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were predictors of CV death or non-fatal MI in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I remained as an independent predictor in multivariate analyses. All lipid variables except low density lipoprotein cholesterol were related to the risk of revascularization in univariate analyses, but only apo A-I and apo B were independent predictors of such events. Triglycerides were weakly, but not independently, associated with prognosis. Verapamil and metoprolol had differential short-term effects on lipids, with a shift towards a more atherogenic profile in metoprolol treated patients. However, there was no significant impact of the treatment given, or of these treatment effects on the risk of CV events. Results of the present study suggest that apolipoprotein levels were better predictors of CV events than other lipid parameters in patients with stable angina pectoris.}

   Abstract={This study compared the effects of 1 year of monotherapy with a calcium-channel antagonist (nilvadipine; NIL), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (temocapril; TEM), or a new vasodilator (cadralazine; CAD) on left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in essential hypertension. Furthermore, to elucidate the mechanism responsible for regression of LV hypertrophy after treatment, LV mass index (LVMI) by echocardiography, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC), norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were measured before and after treatment. Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to the NIL, TEM, or CAD groups. Blood pressure (BP) before treatment was 174 +/- 10/104 +/- 7, 173 +/- 18/103 +/- 8, and 171 +/- 16/103 +/- 7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in NIL, TEM, and CAD groups, respectively. BP was lower after treatment with each of the three test drugs than after the placebo period, and there were no differences in BP reduction among three groups. LVMI, in NIL and TEM, was reduced from 129 +/- 48 to 115 +/- 39 g/m2 and from 117 +/- 39 to 88 +/- 20 g/m2 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), whereas, in the CAD group, it was increased (110 +/- 30 to 138 +/- 27 g/m2; p < 0.01). In the CAD group, PAC decreased and ANP increased significantly. The change in LVMI correlated with that in BP for TEM and with that in ANP in all patients. These data indicated that LV volume overload as well as LV pressure overload may contribute to LV hypertrophy and that monotherapy with CAD is not desirable from the point of view of LV mass reduction in essential hypertension.}

   Abstract={The objective of the HOT study, an international, prospective, randomised study is to determine the optimal level of the blood pressure under treatment, in linked with the lowest cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The target diastolic blood pressure of 80, 85 and 90 mmHg was determined at the randomisation. In order to reach the target blood pressure, a strategy of treatment was determined: the 1st step was felodipine (a long acting dihydropyridine) and the next steps (if the blood pressure reduction is not enough) propose the addition of different therapeutic classes and/or the increase of each drug doses. The available data after 2 years of the patients follow-up allow us to evaluate the incidence of the reported side effects according to the target blood pressure assigned by randomisation and the number of hypertension drugs used to reach these targets. The percentage of patients with at least one side effect at 12 and 24 months of follow-up are respectively: for the target group DBP < or = 90 mmHg: 9.2% versus 6%; for the target group DBP < or = 85 mmHg: 8% versus 4.4%; for the target group DBP < or = 80 mmHg: 7.9% versus 4.9%. The overall tolerability is not influenced by the target diastolic blood pressure but depends on the number of hypertension drugs used. At 24 months, 2.8% of patients are under monotherapy; 7% under bitherapy and 9.8% under tritherapy. The incidence of the side effects decreases after the 1st year, but slower than between the third months and the first year. There is an influence of the region on the incidence of the side effects, the south European countries describing more side effects than France or the north European countries. This seems to be linked with a perception of the side effects more than with a higher rate. In conclusion, these results confirm the possibility to reach a targeted blood pressure using a predetermined strategy without increasing dramatically the incidence of the side effects.}

The patients were randomized to placebo and were still on study treatment 1 month after discharge. Of these patients, 311 (39%) reported chest pain during the first month following discharge.\\ Patients with angina pectoris had a significantly increased risk of reinfarction [hazard 1.71; 95%-confidence limit (CL): 1.09, 2.69] and increased mortality risk which, however, only reached borderline statistical significance (hazard 1.52; 95%-CL: 0.96, 2.40). When patients were subdivided according to both angina pectoris and heart failure, those with one or both of these risk markers had significantly increased mortality (p 0.03) and reinfarction (p 0.02) rates compared with patients free of both angina pectoris and heart failure.\\ Patients with postinfarction angina pectoris have a significantly increased morbidity risk.}

   Abstract={Nicardipine is a potent arteriolar vasodilator with a negligible negative inotropic effect. Although intravenous administration of this drug has been reported to be effective in the treatment of heart failure, the optimal dose by this route is not clear. This study was designed to determine the optimum dose for the intravenous infusion of nicardipine in the treatment of heart failure. In Trial 1, nicardipine was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.5 microgram/kg per min to 14 patients with acute heart failure. The dose was increased to 1.0 microgram/kg per min in 13 cases with marked improvement at 2 h. In Trial 2, nicardipine was administered in a double-blind manner to 53 patients at 3 different rates of infusion for 2 h: 1.0 (Group 1, n = 19), 2.0 (Group 2, n = 15), and 3.0 (Group 3, n = 19) micrograms/kg per min. Neither heart rate nor mean right atrial pressure changed in any of the 3 groups. Favorable hemodynamic effects were evident in all groups beginning 30 min after the start of infusion, with an increase in cardiac index (control vs 2 h after infusion, L/min per m2) (Group 1: 2.2 +/- 0.4 vs 3.1 +/- 0.8, Group 2: 2.2 +/- 0.4 vs 2.9 +/- 0.5, Group 3: 2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 3.1 +/- 0.7, all p < 0.01 compared to the control) and a decrease in diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (Group 1: 26 +/- 10 vs 19 +/- 7, Group 2: 27 +/- 10 vs 20 +/- 8, Group 3: 26 +/- 7 vs 18 +/- 5 mmHg, all p < 0.01). The decrease in systolic pressure was greatest in Group 3 (Group 1: 141 +/- 31 vs 119 +/- 18, Group 2: 149 +/- 25 vs 118 +/- 17, Group 3; 147 +/- 27 vs 107 +/- 14 mmHg, all p < 0.01 compared to control, and p < 0.05 between Groups 1 and 3). The intravenous drip infusion of nicardipine is effective in the treatment of heart failure by inducing an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. The optimal dose in this study was 1.0 microgram/kg per min.}

Two years after randomization, the total mortality was 6.6% in the angina-guided strategy, 4.4% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 1.1% in the revascularization strategy (P<.02). The rate of death or myocardial infarction was 12.1% in the angina-guided strategy, 8.8% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 4.7% in the revascularization strategy (P<.04). The rate of death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent cardiac hospitalization was 41.8% in the angina-guided strategy, 38.5% in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 23.1% in the revascularization strategy (P<.001). Pairwise testing revealed significant differences between the revascularization and angina-guided strategies for each comparison.\\ A strategy of initial revascularization appears to improve the prognosis of this population compared with angina-guided medical therapy. A larger long-term study is needed to confirm this benefit and to adequately test the potential of more aggressive drug therapy.}

   Abstract={In order to compare the efficacy of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) with diltiazem, 99 patients with chronic stable angina were studied in a parallel-group randomised trial. According to the results of the two exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) performed during the placebo run-in, patients were divided into a fixed threshold group if the variability in time to 1 mm ST-segment depression was 20%, or a variable threshold group if it was higher. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the time to 1 mm ST-depression on a bicycle ETT after 4 weeks of treatment, adjusting for the baseline value. The adjusted means were 7.44 min for nifedipine GITS and 7.68 min for diltiazem; the difference was -0.24 min, with a lower 90% confidence limit of -0.90, which is within the stated interval for equivalence. The same result was confirmed by the 'intention-to-treat' analysis, and comparable results were obtained both in fixed and in variable threshold groups. The incidence of side effects was 12% with nifedipine GITS and 8.2% with diltiazem. Nifedipine GITS and diltiazem were found to be equally effective in increasing exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina patients.}

   Abstract={The purpose of the study was to compare the antianginal and hypotensive efficacy and tolerability of 8 weeks of treatment with amlodipine taken once daily and nifedipine taken twice daily in patients with stable exertional angina pectoris and mild-to-moderate hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in-period 13 patients were randomized to receive amlodipine (5 to 10 mg once daily) and 8 patients to receive nifedipine (20 or 40 mg twice daily) in an 8-week treatment phase. Antianginal efficacy was assessed with angina diares, investigators, and patients global evaluations and with treadmill exercise test during placebo run-in-period and after 8 weeks of the therapy. Amlodipine significantly reduced both weekly anginal attacks and consumption of glyceryl trinitrate tablets. This effect was more pronounced compared to efficacy of nifedipine. Exercise tolerance was also improved more markedly after amlodipine than after nifedipine treatment. Amlodipine treatment resulted in significant increase in total exercise time, increase the exercise time to angina onset, increase time to ST segment depression, decrease in ST segment depression, decrease in total duration of ST segment depression and decrease in duration of pain. In patients treated with nifedipine only favourable effect was significant decrease in total duration of ST segment depression, without significant changes of other examined parameters. Both drugs decreased blood pressure with no significant change in heart rate. No serious adverse events occurred in any patients during therapy with amlodipine as well as with nifedipine. The results of the study demonstrate that amlodipine has markedly better anti-anginal efficacy than nifedipine with respect to the most of the parameters examined. However both drugs showed comparable antihypertensive action and both were well tolerated by angina patients. The good anti-anginal and hypotensive efficacy and safety of amiodipine with once daily dosage regimen makes this drug an excellent choice of treatment for hypertensive patients with severe coronary artery disease.}

   Abstract={In order to control critical rises of blood pressure during the peri-operative period in elderly hypertensive patients, the effectiveness of a continuous intravenous infusion of nifedipine was studied. In a double blind study, patients (n = 60) who underwent eye surgery under local anesthesia were divided randomly into three groups. Patients who were found to have 200 > SBP > 160 and 120 > DBP > 90 mmHg as the previous day of surgery, as well as patients who did not receive any anti-hypertensive treatment regimen during the last week before surgery, were selected. Five min before performing local anesthesia, a continuous infusion of nifedipine at two different rates of 0.65 mg/h and 1.25 mg/h, was administered in groups A and B respectively, whereas group C received a placebo. SBP, DBP and HR were recorded every 5 min. for an hour. Statistically significant differences among the profiles of the three groups were found. The control group had a higher SBP/DBP. None of the groups, showed significant changes in HR. In conclusion, the intravenous infusion of nifedipine in a dose 1.25 mg/h, seems to control the hypertensive phases of blood pressure, without dropping to any unduly low level, risking undesirable side effects in elderly hypertensive patients during perioperative period.}

   Abstract={Nifedipine induces overgrowth of gingival tissues in some patients. However, other collagenous tissues in their body do not overgrow. The purpose of this study was to compare effects of serial dilutions of nifedipine on the in vitro metabolism of fibroblasts derived from normal gingiva, nifedipine-induced hyperplastic gingiva, knee capsular ligament, and dermis. The data suggested that nifedipine affects the metabolism of fibroblasts derived not only from gingiva, but also from other collective connective tissues. Thus, nifedipine-responder cells are present in tissues other than gingiva. There was an inverse relationship between in vivo tissue levels of IL-1-beta and in vitro responsiveness to nifedipine of fibroblasts derived from that tissue. Nifedipine-induced overgrowth of connective tissues, other than gingiva, probably does not occur either because of the relatively slow rate of collagenous protein synthesis by resident fibroblasts or because of alterations in collagen deposition/resorption within susceptible tissues produced by nifedipine on collagenase synthesis.}

Exclusion criteria included ventricular response rate lower than 100 or higher than 200 beats/minute, allergy to study drugs, hypotension with evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion, and conduction abnormalities. Consenting patients were randomly assigned to receive rapid digitalization (1.0 mg over 2 hours) or i.v. verapamil (sequential 5-mg boluses up to 20 mg). After ventricular rate was controlled (< 100 beats/minute), oral quinidine (200 mg) was initiated and repeated every 2 hours until conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) occurred, until 1 g of quinidine was administered, or until adverse effects supervened. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, time to conversion, and adverse effects were documented.\\ Forty-four patients received the study drugs. Three were withdrawn, leaving 19 in the verapamil-quinidine (VER-Q) group and 22 in the digoxin-quinidine (DIG-Q) group. Sixteen patients (84%) in the VER-Q group and 10 (45%) in the DIG-Q group converted to NSR within 6 hours (P < .02). Mean time to conversion (+/-SD) was 185 +/- 146 minutes for VER-Q and 368 +/- 386 minutes for DIG-Q patients (P = NS). Twelve VER-Q patients (63%) and 6 DIG-Q patients (27%) were discharged from the ED (P < .05). Minor adverse effects were more common in the VER-Q group. No mortality or significant morbidity occurred.\\ The sequential combination of verapamil and quinidine, in the doses studied, is an effective treatment for PAF and is superior to digoxin-quinidine. Digoxin should no longer be considered the treatment of choice for uncomplicated PAF.}

A total of 174 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension from 15 hospitals in Germany and Poland was included in the study. Eighty-seven were treated with the alpha-receptor blocker bunazosin and the same number with the beta-blocker atenolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups, whereas only atenolol decreased pulse rate. In the bunazosin group HDL-cholesterol was significantly increased after 6 months of treatment, whereas all other analysed parameters remained unchanged. In the atenolol group total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total triglycerides, apolipoprotein E, VLDL-cholesterol and VLDL-triglycerides were significantly increased after 6 months of therapy. There was a significant difference between bunazosin and atenolol for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides and apolipoprotein B levels. As a consequence, there was a significant difference in the atherogenic index of both groups. We conclude that bunazosin is favorable in the treatment of high blood pressure, because the coronary risk is not negatively influenced as shown for atenolol.}

   Abstract={The present study was carried out to investigate exercise test results and the outcome of the quality of life after administration of trapidil (CAS 15421-84-8, Rocornal) or nifedipine (CAS 21829-25-4) to patients with coronary heart disease. The characteristics of the life quality in combination with the results of exercise test are considered of great importance for selecting medical treatment in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. However, little information is available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best pharmacological approach in individual patients. In this prospective multicentre study, 144 patients with stable angina were enrolled in 6 centres. Due to protocol violations and drop-outs 116 patients were evaluated for tolerability; 101 patients were evaluated for efficacy. After baseline evaluation, consisting of an exercise test and a questioning investigating patients' anginal symptoms and several psychometric testings, the patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment for 12 weeks with either trapidil, 200 mg t.i.d. or nifedipine, 10 mg t.i.d. according to a parallel group design. After 6 and 12 weeks exercise tests and psychometric testings were repeated. Both trapidil and nifedipine prolonged exercise tolerance (trapidil 39.2% vs. nifedipine 33.3%) or increased the total exercise over baseline levels (trapidil 57.8% vs. nifedipine 61.2%). Using Mann-Whitney U-test the SB-S-rating scale and the physician's assessment revealed a comparable improvement of life quality (trapidil 69.4% vs. nifedipine 80.0%) under both treatments. In addition patient questioning showed a significant reduction in angina attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption. None of the characteristics of anginal symptoms or exercise test gave evidence for a significant difference between nifedipine and trapidil. Both drugs demonstrated similar safety profiles (adverse events (AEs) 12.7% for trapidil and 11.1% for nifedipine); four patients of the trapidil group and one of the nifedipine group discontinued the clinical trial because of AEs. The results of a baseline exercise test and rating questionnaires may offer useful information for selecting medical treatment in stable angina pectoris.}

   Abstract={International, prospective, randomized HOT study aims to determine the optimal BP level under treatment in order to reduce at the most the cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. Defined by randomization, the level to obtain is DBP < or = 80, 85, 90 mmHg. The treatment is started by felodipine 5 mg/day then, if necessary, a bitherapy is prescribed and then, if necessary, a tritherapy. 19,193 patients have been included (BP at randomization 170 +/- 15/105 +/- 4 mmHg). After 1 year treatment, it is possible to search for the influence on the clinical tolerance of sex, age, BP goal, geographic area, time and treatment. The percentage of patients with side effects by BP goals and by treatment type are, during the time and in different geographic areas, the following (NE/Northern Europe = Norway, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, The Netherlands, UK, Germany, Austria; SE/Southern Europe = Italy, Spain, Greece): [table: see text] The target BP and age don't nearly influence the clinical tolerance. The side effects reported by the physicians are more numerous at the treatment start than at longeur terme. That is due to the therapeutic modifications of the physicians or to a better acceptation of the drugs by the patients or to a real disappearance of the side effects. Reported side effects are more frequent in Southern Europe, France than Northern Europe and more frequent among women that men. The incidence of side effects is proportional to the number of prescribed drugs. Time and the number of antihypertensive drugs appear as the most important factors.}

   Abstract={This was a double-blind, within-patient, crossover study to evaluate the effects of a new formulation of metoprolol on blood pressure (BP) and myocardial ischemia. Twenty outpatients with mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris and positive exercise test, after a 2-week baseline placebo period, were randomized to receive long-acting metoprolol (OROS) 14/190 mg o.d., nifedipine SR 20 mg b.i.d. or their combination in a sequence of a 3 x 3 Latin square design. Two patients withdrew from the study (1 for adverse event during metoprolol and 1 for rise of BP during nifedipine). Nifedipine, metoprolol and their combination significantly reduced the weekly number of angina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption with respect to baseline. The total number of ischemic events (at 24-hour ECG monitoring) significantly decreased after each treatment with respect to baseline. Twenty-four hours mean systolic and diastolic BP were reduced by both nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone; the combination of the two drugs led to a further decrease in both systolic and diastolic BP. The duration of silent ischemic episodes was significantly reduced by nifedipine and combination but not by metoprolol. On the other hand 24 hours symptomatic attacks/patient were significantly reduced by beta-blocker and combination, but not by nifedipine. Metoprolol alone and administered with nifedipine caused a decrease, with respect to placebo baseline, in 24-hour mean heart rate (HR) and reduced the increase of HR and systolic BP at the onset of ST depression during symptomatic ischemic episodes. The effort time and time to ST = -1 mm at treadmill were significantly increased by treatment with nifedipine alone, with metoprolol alone and with their combination, but the combination was more effective than the individual therapies. ST depression at peak exercise was significantly reduced by each treatment. The slopes of correlations between the ST-segment variation and systolic BP, HR and rate-pressure product during exercise, significantly decreased after all treatments with respect to placebo baseline, more with the combination therapy than with nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone. In conclusion, based on our results the favourable interaction of metoprolol OROS and nifedipine given concomitantly, is likely to be due to a better control, respect to each individual therapy, of the pathogenetic mechanism of myocardia ischemia: BP and HR increases during exercise and during symptomatic ischemic episodes are controlled by the beta-blocker and coronary vasoconstriction during silent ischemia is prevented by the calcium-antagonist.}

   Abstract={Of the large number of agents under development for the treatment of herpes virus infections [herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)], only ten have apparently reached clinical development. Aciclovir was approved for the treatment of HSV infections over 10 years ago, and it remains an important and reliable antiviral agent. Recent approvals in some countries of valaciclovir for VZV infection and famciclovir for both HSV and VZV infections demonstrate the rapidity of change in this field. Intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet are approved for the treatment of CMV infection in the immunocompromised patient. Five of the antiherpetic drugs under current clinical development are nucleoside analogues or their prodrugs; another is a phosphorylated nucleoside (nucleotide). Four of the nucleoside agents-penciclovir, famciclovir, valaciclovir and lobucavir-are being developed for the management of HSV and VZV infections. Valaciclovir is also being developed for the prevention of CMV infections and famciclovir and lobucavir for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection. Oral ganciclovir, lobucavir, ISIS 2922 and cidofovir are being developed for the suppression of CMV infections in immunocompromised patients. Sorivudine has been studied in VZV infections. n-Docosanol is under development for HSV infections, and cidofovir is being developed for both HSV and CMV infections, as well as for treatment of other viral diseases. Traditionally, the adverse effects associated with anti-CMV compounds have been more difficult to manage and are acceptable clinically only because of the severity of the underlying infection and lack of safer therapeutic alternatives. In general, toxicity issues continue to be problematic in the anti-CMV arena, although newer agents have improved the situation to some extent. In contrast, the safety of anti-HSV compounds has traditionally been excellent, establishing a safety standard that must be met by newer agents entering the field.}

   Abstract={To compare the use of adenosine and the use of verapamil as out-of-hospital therapy for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).\\ A period of prospective adenosine use (March 1993 to February 1994) was compared with a historical control period of verapamil use (March 1990 to February 1991) for SVT. Data were obtained for SVT patients treated in a metropolitan, fire-department-based paramedic system serving a population of approximately 1 million persons. Standard drug protocols were used and patient outcomes (i.e., conversion rates, complications, and recurrences) were monitored.\\ During the adenosine treatment period, 105 patients had SVT; 87 (83%) received adenosine, of whom 60 (69%) converted to a sinus rhythm (SR). Vagal maneuvers (VM) resulted in restoration of SR in 8 patients (7.6%). Some patients received adenosine for non-SVT rhythms: 7 sinus tachycardia, 18 atrial fibrilation, 7 wide-complex tachycardia (WCT), and 2 ventricular tachycardia; no non-SVT rhythm converted to SR and none of these patients experienced an adverse effect. Twenty-five patients were hemodynamically unstable (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), with 20 receiving drug and 13 converting to SR; 8 patients required electrical cardioversion. Four patients experienced adverse effects related to adenosine (chest pain dyspnea, prolonged bradycardia, and ventricular tachycardia). In the verapamil period, 106 patients had SVT: 52 (49%) received verapamil (p < 0.001, compared with the adenosine period), of whom 43 (88%) converted to SR (p = 0.11). Two patients received verapamil for WCT; neither converted to SR and both experienced cardiovascular collapse. VM resulted in restoration of SR in 12 patients (11.0%) (p = 0.52). Sixteen patients were hemodynamically unstable, with 5 receiving drug (p = 0.005) and 5 converting to SR; 9 patients required electrical cardioversion (p = 0.48). Four patients experienced adverse effects related to verapamil (hypotension ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation). Recurrence of SVT was noted in 2 adenosine patients and 2 verapamil patients in the out-of-hospital setting and in 23 adenosine patients and 15 verapamil patients after ED arrival, necessitating additional therapy (p = 0.48 and 0.88, for recurrence rates and types of additional therapies, respectively). Hospital diagnoses, outcomes, and ED dispositions were similar for the 2 groups.\\ Adenosine and verapamil were equally successful in converting out-of-hospital SVT in patients with similar etiologies responsible for the SVT. Recurrence of SVT occurred at similar rates for the 2 medications. Rhythm misidentification remains a common issue in out-of-hospital cardiac care in this emergency medical services system.}

The medication of 39 patients with hypertension was changed from once-daily diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem CD) or nifedipine (Procardia XL) to felodipine (Plendil). Titration to a final dose was based on home and office blood pressure measurements assessed over subsequent follow-up clinic visits. Self-administered questionnaires measured different aspects of well-being and symptoms before and after the change in medication. Eighty percent of the cohort switched successfully to felodipine. Office systolic and diastolic pressures improved after the medication change (systolic: 150 mm Hg versus 144 mm Hg; diastolic: 92 mm Hg versus 87 mm Hg). No statistically significant differences were found among the 39 symptoms measured. A yearly savings potential for our institution was estimated to be $72,000.}

   Abstract={Are newer types of antihypertensive agents, which are currently more costly to purchase on average, as good or better than diuretics in reducing coronary heart disease incidence and progression? Will lowering LDL cholesterol in moderately hypercholesterolemic older individuals reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and total mortality? These important medical practice and public health questions are to be addressed by the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind trial in 40,000 high-risk hypertensive patients. ALLHAT is designed to determine whether the combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction differs between persons randomized to diuretic (chlorthalidone) treatment and each of three alternative treatments--a calcium antagonist (amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). ALLHAT also contains a randomized, open-label, lipid-lowering trial designed to determine whether lowering LDL cholesterol in 20,000 moderately hypercholesterolemic patients (a subset of the 40,000) with a 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, will reduce all-cause mortality compared to a control group receiving "usual care." ALLHAT's main eligibility criteria are: 1) age 55 or older; 2) systolic or diastolic hypertension; and 3) one or more additional risk factors for heart attack (eg, evidence of atherosclerotic disease or type II diabetes). For the lipid-lowering trial, participants must have an LDL cholesterol of 120 to 189 mg/dL (100 to 129 mg/dL for those with known CHD) and a triglyceride level below 350 mg/dL. The mean duration of treatment and follow-up is planned to be 6 years. Further features of the rationale, design, objectives, treatment program, and study organization of ALLHAT are described in this article.}

   Abstract={Medical therapy of stable angina contemplates beta-blockers as a first line. The combination of dihydropyridines with beta-blocking drugs enhances the effectiveness of both single therapies. Nifedipine, in the usual formulation (AR), is burdened by an unsatisfactory tolerability, and this is the main reason to study new dihydropyridines.\\ To compare efficacy and tolerability of felodipine ER 10 mg o.d. with that of nifedipine AR 20 mg b.d. in patients with stable angina pectoris refractory to beta-blocker therapy.\\ Of 15 initial patients, 14 were entirely evaluable for the study, the design of which was double blind, double dummy, random cross over and placebo controlled. All patients showed reproducible threshold of ischemia at exercise testing. In constancy of beta-blocker therapy, they were given placebos for 2 weeks, then one of the active drugs with a placebo of the other one for 4 weeks, followed by the cross-over period of 4 weeks. Efficacy and tolerability of treatments were evaluated by clinical observation and rest and exercise radionuclide angiography. At the end of each individual study, it was decided blindly if and which of the 2 drugs seemed preferable, considering symptoms, undesired collateral effects and the results of exercise procedures.\\ The efficacy on angina of the 2 active treatments was not different. More patients suffered undesired side effects on nifedipine than on felodipine. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest was 65.3 +/- 4.3% (s.e.) on placebo, 64.6 +/- 2.6% on felodipine and 67.5 +/- 2.5% on nifedipine (p n.s.). A significant reduction in resting LV function (that is, a decrease of LVEF > or = 5%) was observed in 2 patients on felodipine and 3 on nifedipine, but in both groups other 3 patients showed improvement in LVEF. During exercise, LVEF decreased 6.1 +/- 2.0% on placebo and 3.3 +/- 3.2% on nifedipine, while it increased 1.0 +/- 2.6% on felodipine (p < 0.01 vs. placebo). At the end of the study, felodipine was blindly judged superior to nifedipine in 10 patients, nifedipine was superior in 1 case, in the other 3 there was no clear difference (p < 0.02).\\ In 14 patients with stable angina refractory to beta-blockers, the addition of felodipine or nifedipine has similar antiischemic effects. However, felodipine showed better results in LVEF response to exercise and less side effects, and this leaded to a more frequent blind choice of felodipine versus nifedipine to add to beta-blocker therapy.}

Patients were then randomized to receive either 5 mg of amlodipine as a morning dose, or 180 mg of diltiazem in three divided doses. After two weeks, the dosage was able to be increased (according to clinical efficacy) to 10 mg of amlodipine as a single dose or 240 mg of diltiazem in four divided doses. The antianginal efficacy of these two treatments was essentially evaluated in terms of the results of stress tests (ST) conducted at the end of the second week and fourth week of active treatment: and 24 hours after the last dose of the drug. The results of 63 patients who scrupulously complied with the protocol showed that amlodipine and diltiazem corrected or improved the ST parameters (time to onset and amplitude of ST depression, duration of ST, work performed). The anti-ischaemic action of amlodipine was maintained for at least 24 hours after the last dose and therefore provides better security (by covering the entire 24-hour period) and better compliance (by tolerating a dose omission of several hours).}

Anti-arrhythmic medication was started with the procedure and was continued until the 3rd postoperative day.\\ Preoperative conditions were the same for the three groups concerning age, extent of coronary heart disease, ventricular function and heart-related medication. There were no differences in intraoperative parameters or postoperative enzyme patterns. Diltiazem was ineffective in preventing SVT, the incidence being exactly the same as in the control group (35%). Propranolol reduced the occurrence of SVT significantly (7%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients treated with diltiazem needed positive inotropic support more often in the first hours after surgery than patients of the control group (30% vs 5%, P < 0.01).\\ The perioperative administration of low-dose propranolol is considered a safe and effective drug prophylaxis to avoid the occurrence of SVT after bypass surgery.}

   Abstract={The effect of dihydropyridines in patients with unstable angina is discouraging. To find out the effect of the non-dihydropyridine-like calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, a randomised, double-blind trial was conducted comparing diltiazem with glyceryl trinitrate, both given intravenously, in 129 patients with unstable angina. The endpoints were refractory angina or myocardial infarction, individually and as a composite endpoint. Refractory angina alone or together with myocardial infarction occurred significantly less commonly in the diltiazem group. While patients were on the trial drugs the numbers with refractory angina were 6 (10%) in the diltiazem group versus 17 (28%) in the glyceryl trinitrate group (relative risk 0.36, p = 0.02), and the numbers with refractory angina and myocardial infarction were 9 (15%) versus 23 (38%) (relative risk 0.40, p = 0.007). Over 48 h the number were: refractory angina 8 (13%) versus 18 (30%), relative risk 0.45, p = 0.03, and refractory angina and myocardial infarction 12 (20.0%) versus 25 (41%), relative risk 0.49, p = 0.02. Patients in the diltiazem group had better (p < 0.05) event-free survival while taking the drugs. Heart-rate pressure product was reduced significantly only by diltiazem (p < 0.05). The incidence of bradyarrhythmias did not differ significantly. Atrioventricular conduction disturbances occurred in 5 (8%) patients in the diltiazem group but were not seen in the glyceryl trinitrate group (p = 0.03). These disturbances could be reversed by decreasing the dose of the drug or withdrawing it. No temporary pacemakers were required. Headache requiring an analgesic or dose adjustment occurred significantly less in the diltiazem group: 3 (5%) versus 15 (25%), relative risk 0.20 (p < 0.004). These results indicate that intravenous diltiazem, compared with intravenous glyceryl trinitrate, significantly reduces ischaemic events and can be used safely in patients with unstable angina.}

Incidence of hypotensive episodes during the infusion were observed in both groups [nicardipine 5% (1/20) and nitroglycerin 30% (6/20), p < 0.05].\\ Intravenous nicardipine is as effective as nitroglycerin in the treatment of perioperative hypertension. Specific advantages have been identified such as stable dose-response effect, less hypotensive and tachycardial effects during the use of iv nicardipine in treatment of hypertensive patients.}

   Abstract={The prevalence of hypertension and its cardiovascular complications is higher in African Americans than in whites. Interventions to control blood pressure in this population are particularly important. Regular exercise lowers blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, but its effects in patients with severe hypertension have not been studied. We examined the effects of moderately intense exercise on blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy in African-American men with severe hypertension.\\ We randomly assigned 46 men 35 to 76 years of age to exercise plus antihypertensive medication (23 men) or antihypertensive medication alone (23 men). A total of 18 men in the exercise group completed 16 weeks of exercise, and 14 completed 32 weeks of exercise, which was performed three times per week at 60 to 80 percent of the maximal heart rate.\\ After 16 weeks, mean (+/- SD) diastolic blood pressure had decreased from 88 +/- 7 to 83 +/- 8 mm Hg in the patients who exercised, whereas it had increased slightly, from 88 +/- 6 to 90 +/- 7 mm Hg, in those who did not exercise (P = 0.002). Diastolic blood pressure remained significantly lower after 32 weeks of exercise, even with substantial reductions in the dose of antihypertensive medication. In addition, the thickness of the interventricular septum (P = 0.03), the left ventricular mass (P = 0.02), and the mass index (P = 0.04) had decreased significantly after 16 weeks in the patients who exercised, whereas there was no significant change in the nonexercisers.\\ Regular exercise reduced blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy in African-American men with severe hypertension.}

   Abstract={The HOT study (hypertension-optimal treatment) is an international clinical study on primary prevention of cardiovascular events in 19,193 hypertensive patients worldwide. It aims at the recognition of the optimal diastolic blood pressure value (< 90, < 85 or < 80 mmHg?) in order to maximize the possible benefit of an antihypertensive therapy. In addition, the HOT study investigates whether low doses of aspirin (75 mg/day) are able to reduce the occurrence of severe cardiovascular events. In Switzerland a total of 797 patients have been enrolled in the study. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated with felodipine = Plendil (5 mg/day). This vasoelective calcium antagonist could reduce diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mg/Hg, respectively, in one of two or one of three patients within the first three months. In nine or six patients, respectively out of ten a reduction of diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mmHg was reached within one year by combination of felodipine with other antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and diuretics).}

   Abstract={A double-blind, three-period, crossover trial used 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to compare diltiazem controlled diffusion (CD) 300 mg with placebo. Patients with hypertension (N = 43) were randomly assigned to one of four crossover treatment sequences of three treatment periods each. Ambulatory blood pressure was obtained at the end of each 4-week treatment period. Diltiazem CD significantly decreased diastolic and systolic blood pressure at bihourly ambulatory blood pressure evaluations (p < 0.05, all). However, when all ambulatory blood pressure monitoring data were combined into one statistical model, blood pressure reductions were quantifiably similar to those in the overall bihourly analysis, but with a consistent 24-hour antihypertensive effect for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure relative to that with placebo (i.e., parallel blood pressure profiles) and with increased precision. Mean +/- SE changes in diastolic and systolic blood pressure across the 24-hour dosing interval were -5.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg and -7.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, respectively (p < 0.001, both). Therefore, by using a crossover design with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, we showed diltiazem CD to reduce blood pressure consistently throughout a 24-hour dosing interval in comparison with placebo in patients with hypertension.}

   Abstract={Laser energy produces a multitude of effects, resulting both in therapeutic tissue ablation and complications such as laser-induced spasm (LIS). LIS can occur during lasing itself or during subsequent adjunctive angioplasty. Intracoronary diltiazem (ICD) can partially reverse LIS after it occurs. To determine whether pre-treatment with ICD might prevent LIS during laser interventions, 3 groups of 50 lesions each were studied. Group 1 served as controls receiving no ICD during the procedure. Group 2 received 2.5 mg ICD before lasing. Group 3 received ICD before lasing and then a second infusion of 2.5 mg ICD after lasing but before adjunctive therapy. There were no differences in clinical characteristics of the 3 groups. Over 75% of lesions in each group were complex (B2 or C) lesions, and average lesion length was 15 mm in all 3 groups. Procedural success was > or = 94% in all groups. There was no significant difference among groups in pre-procedure artery stenosis, post-procedure stenosis, laser power used or number of laser pulses delivered. Pretreatment with ICD produced vasodilation of the minimum lumen diameter from 0.86 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm (p < 0.01) and was well tolerated. Control patients exhibited a 12% incidence of LIS. Group 2 had an 80% reduction of LIS during lasing (p < 0.01) but had increased LIS during adjunctive therapy with the same 12% incidence of LIS overall. Group 3 had only a 2% incidence of LIS (p < 0.01). We concluded that pretreatment with ICD significantly reduces LIS. Multiple infusions of ICD are necessary to sustain this protective effect.}

   Abstract={Hyperlipidemia is a common side-effect of oral retinoid treatment, which sometimes interferes with long-term therapy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the lipid-lowering drug gemfibrozil on retinoid-associated hyperlipidemia, we studied the clinical response and the plasma lipoprotein levels in 22 acitretin-treated (0.25-0.75 mg/kg) patients mainly suffering from psoriasis. Gemfibrozil or placebo was given in a double-blind cross-over fashion to 14 patients, who after 8 weeks of acitretin therapy and dietary advice exhibited hyperlipidemia (triglyceride levels > or = 50% above baseline and/or > or = 2.0 mmol/l). Serum triglycerides remained high (3.7 +/- 2.4 mmol/l) during placebo treatment but were reduced after 8 weeks of gemfibrozil treatment (p < 0.01). The total cholesterol level decreased slightly (p < 0.05) during gemfibrozil treatment, but the LDL/HDL ratio did not change significantly. No untoward effects of gemfibrozil on acitretin dose-response and clinical side-effects were noted. Gemfibrozil thus appears useful in patients prone to retinoid-induced hyperlipidemia unresponsive to dietary treatment and acitretin dose reductions.}

   Abstract={Diltiazem (Tildiem 60 mg) is a calcium channel blocker with demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of stable angina pectoris and spastic angina. The sustained release formulation of diltiazem, allowing two daily doses (Bi-Tildiem 120 mg), is already marketed in France for the treatment of stable angina. It was therefore interesting to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this form, administered in two daily doses, in coronary spasm, versus the classical formulation, Tildiem 60 mg, given at the same daily dose, i.e. 240 mg, in three divided doses per day. We conducted a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical study in twelve patients, eleven men and one woman, between the ages of 42 and 70 years, presenting with angina and normal coronary arteries and spasm documented by a positive methylergonovine (Methergin) test. They were divided into two groups of six patients receiving either Tildiem followed by Bi-Tildiem, or Bi-Tildiem followed by Tildiem. The characteristics of the two groups were comparable at the time of the selection visit. The methylergonovine test, used to assess the efficacy of the two treatments, was improved by Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem compared to the placebo test (p = 0.001 and 0.002), without any significant difference between Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem: an improvement was obtained in 11/12 and 10/12 patients, respectively. No deterioration of the test was observed with Tildiem or Bi-Tildiem compared to placebo. The coronary symptoms and blood diltiazem levels were similar with Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem. The results confirmed the safety of Bi-Tildiem. A single adverse effect was attributed to treatment: an episode of mild insomnia. No serious adverse effect were observed and none of the patients discontinued the study. The efficacy and safety of Tildiem and Bi-Tildiem are comparable in the treatment of spastic angina.}

   Abstract={Prognosis of unstable angina pectoris is related to admission EKG changes and prompt symptom control. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effects of intravenous diltiazem (DTZ) or nitroglycerin (NTG) in patients with unstable angina pectoris. We studied 43 patients admitted to the hospital with a history of rest angina within the last 48 hours, associated with EKG evidence of ischemia. All subjects received intravenous heparin and oral aspirin, 23 were randomly assigned to receive intravenous DTZ and 20 to receive intravenous NTG. Both groups had similar baseline features and the endpoints of treatment were recurrence of angina, myocardial infarction, death during hospitalization and secondary side effects. Treatment with DTZ, when compared to NTG, resulted in a significant reduction of recurrent angina (8.7 and 59% respectively; p < 0.005), number of angina episodes per patient (0.18 +/- 0.5 and 0.9 +/- 1.2 respectively; p < 0.05) and lower need for dose increment to control symptoms (3 and 9 patients respectively; p < 0.05). The most common side effects observed were cephalea with NTG (60% of patients) and asymptomatic sinus bradicardia with DTZ (28% of patients). In each group, one patient had a myocardial infarction and one patient died. It is concluded that intravenous DTZ reduces myocardial ischemia to a greater extent than NTG and can be safely used in patients with unstable angina pectoris.}

   Abstract={Thrombogenesis is considered the principal cause of early failure of arterial grafts. Although antithrombotic drugs are recommended, their efficiency under low blood flow conditions is still being debated. In this study, we evaluated the ability of three drugs to modify the thrombotic properties of blood and, consequently, to influence platelet and fibrin deposition on the luminal surface of polyester arterial prostheses. In dogs receiving saline (control, n = 10), heparin (100 U/kg, n = 5), aspirin (325 mg, n = 5), or prostacyclin (15 ng/kg/min, n = 5), a 30-cm, woven, loop-shaped, DeBakey arterial prosthesis was implanted as a substitute for the infrarenal aorta and exposed to reduced blood flow (50 ml/min) for 4 h. The parameters of the blood measured included activated clotting time (ACT) and platelet aggregation with collagen, determined before and after each treatment. Blood deposits were quantified using 111In labeled platelets and 125I-labeled fibrinogen. The ACT was significantly prolonged only after heparin treatment, and platelet aggregation, which was decreased by 35% (p < 0.05) after heparin treatment, was almost abolished after aspirin and prostacyclin treatments. As compared with the control group, both platelet and fibrin uptake on the luminal surface of the prostheses were reduced significantly by heparin by 87 and 37%, respectively. Despite their inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro, aspirin and prostacyclin induced no significant change in platelet and fibrin deposition on the luminal surface of the woven polyester arterial prostheses under low blood flow conditions. Under such conditions, however, thrombin generation with subsequent platelet-fibrin deposition was prevented by use of heparin anticoagulant therapy.}

After a placebo run-in period of 1-4 weeks, patients were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups: placebo (n = 48), spirapril 1.5 mg (n = 48), spirapril 3 mg (n = 53), spirapril 6 mg (n = 51) or enalapril 5/10 mg (n = 48). The primary objective was to assess changes in exercise tolerance, and the secondary objective was an assessment of cardiovascular signs and symptoms, quality of life, ejection fraction and chest X-ray findings. Exercise tolerance increased in all groups; however, no statistically significant differences were found between any of the groups. There was a statistically significant reduction of mortality in the pooled spirapril groups compared with placebo, and a trend for reduction of serious cardiovascular adverse events as well as duration of hospitalization. These effects and improvements in lung congestion appeared to be dose dependent. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the combination with first-generation calcium channel blockers had an unfavourable effect on exercise capacity and clinical parameters. Spirapril might be an effective alternative to enalapril in the treatment of patients with CHF. The role of the exercise tolerance test in establishing efficacy of ACEIs in CHF and the widespread use of nifedipine in CHF is questioned.}

   Abstract={The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of diltiazem bolus intravenous administration, compared to disopyramide, in the treatment of various types of paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\\ Fifty patients (23 males, 27 females, mean age 47.7 +/- 15.2 years) with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (20 with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, 23 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response and 7 with atrial fluttering) were studied. Diltiazem at a dose of 0.25-0.30 mg/kg BW or disopyramide at a dose of 50 mg were given bolus IV. If conversion of the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm could not be achieved with the initial drug, the alternate was given. The order of administration of the drugs was random, independent of the type of the arrhythmia. Before and during drug administration detailed clinical examination and frequent blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed. Twenty-four hour Holter monitoring was done in all patients, starting with the administration of the antiarrhythmic drug.\\ 1) Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia: diltiazem administration converted the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm in all patients while disopyramide in only 1 of 9 patients who received this drug. 2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: disopyramide converted the arrhythmia in 5 patients without significant change in ventricular response in the others. Diltiazem did not convert the arrhythmia though it caused significant decrease in ventricular response (< 100 bpm) and in 1 patient an important bradycardia (45 bpm). 3) Atrial fluttering: disopyramide converted the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm in 1 patient without significant change in the ventricular response in the others. Diltiazem caused significant decrease in the ventricular response without conversion to sinus rhythm. During conversion to sinus rhythm an AV junctional rhythm of short duration (< 1 min) was noticed in 5 patients and a short pause (< 2 sec) with or without an initial premature contraction in the remaining 21. Disopyramide administration was not associated with side effects. Diltiazem administration cause small (< 20 mm Hg), transient (< 30 min) decrease of BP without symptoms with the exception of the patient with bradycardia in whom the BP decrease was significant (90/60 from 160/80 mm Hg) followed by intense symptoms which lasted for six hours.\\ Diltiazem administration is extremely effective in conversion of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia to sinus rhythm. In addition it retards ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation and fluttering. Compared to disopyramide these effects of diltiazem are more pronounced and clinically pertinent.}

The patients of the N group were then given nicardipine 0.016 mg.kg-1 and those of the SO4Mg group received magnesium sulphate 50 mg.kg-1.\\ Anaesthesia technique was identical and during normothermic CPB the flow remained constant at 2.4 L.min-1, during the 10 min following N or SO4Mg administration. The usual haemodynamic variables were monitored.\\ Both N and SO4Mg decreased significantly the MAP and the SVR over the 9 min following their administration. The decrease was more marked after SO4Mg. As the flow of the pump was unchanged after their injection the decrease can be attributed to the relaxing effect of these agents on the smooth vascular muscles.\\ SO4Mg permits to treat hypertensive peaks occurring during CPB as efficiently as N. Three grammes of SO4Mg have an hypotensive effect equivalent to that of 1 mg of nicardipine. However repetitive injections of SO4Mg cannot be recommended because of the risk for hypermagnesemia.}

Heart rate did not change appreciably during either treatment. On completion of nicardipine treatment, 87.5% of patients had suffered no angina attacks, compared with 66.7% for nifedipine. The remaining 12.5% of patients treated with nicardipine presented only one mild angina attack per day, while the other 33.3% of the nifedipine patients had one moderate angina attack per day. No untoward effects were reported with nicardipine; one patient receiving nifedipine presented cardiopalmus and another complained of headache. These results indicate that nicardipine is at least as safe and effective as nifedipine in the treatment of unstable angina.}

   Abstract={Verapamil can modulate multidrug resistance in vitro, but only at levels that are not tolerable when administered systemically. Regional strategies of drug administration may permit the delivery of high concentrations of a drug to specific areas with lower systemic levels. Colorectal cancers typically express the multidrug resistance phenotype.\\ A Phase I trial was performed to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities of verapamil by hepatic artery infusion, together with doxorubicin, to patients with hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer. Fourteen patients with metastatic colorectal cancer received a 14-hour intrahepatic infusion of verapamil. Six hours after the start of the infusion, a fixed dose of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) was given, also via the hepatic artery, over a 30-minute period. Patients were followed by cardiac telemetry but were not in an intensive care setting, and no invasive monitoring was used. All patients had received prior intrahepatic chemotherapy.\\ The MTD of intrahepatic verapamil on this schedule in this patient population was 1.2 mg/kg/hour. Hypotension was the dose limiting toxicity. No major objective responses were noted in this heavily pretreated patient population. A dose of 1.0 mg/kg/hour is recommended for Phase II trials.\\ Based on estimations of normal hepatic artery blood flow, the estimated concentration of verapamil delivered to the hepatic tumors at 1.0 mg/kg/hour is 3.6 micrograms/ml (7.3 microM), which is comparable to concentrations at which an in vitro reversal of MDR is seen. This study demonstrates that the systemic toxicities of an MDR reversal agent can be overcome by regional drug delivery, establishing this approach as an important model system for further study of MDR modulation.}

   Abstract={In addition to laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and other stressful intraoperative phases, hypertension occurs during recovery from anaesthesia, provoking post-operative complications like bleeding and increased intracranial or intraocular pressure. Furthermore, these hypertensive reactions result in life-threatening complications, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. In this study, the effect of the new, short-acting beta-blocker esmolol given as a single bolus for preventing the increases in blood pressure and heart rate during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation in patients with hypertension was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Sixty-three patients with a history of hypertension over a period of more than 6 months and blood pressure (BP) more than 150/90 mm Hg undergoing intervertebral-disc, otolaryngologic, or eye surgery were included in the study. The operations were performed during thiopentone-induced isoflurane anaesthesia with relaxation by atracurium. The patients were assigned to three groups after giving witnessed oral informed consent. During the study period they received the study drug twice: (A) 30-90 s before turning off the nitrous oxide; and (B) 20-90 s before extubation. Group I (placebo) received placebo each time, group II (100 mg esmolol) placebo at A and 100 mg esmolol i.v. at B, and group III (200 mg esmolol) 100 mg esmolol i.v. each time. After each medication the cardiovascular parameters were measured noninvasively over a period of 10 min every minute and in the following 2 h every 15 min. RESULTS. After the first medication systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate (HR), and rate-pressure product (RPP) were lower in patients receiving 100 mg esmolol (Group III) than in groups I and II. After the second injection the blood pressure was lower in the two groups receiving 100 mg esmolol, than the placebo group (I: 180.1 +/- 7.4/100.7 +/- 3.6; II: 152.8 +/- 5.8/87.9 +/- 3.4; III: 157.9 +/- 5.3/91.5 +/- 3.6 mm Hg [mean 2 min +/- SEM]). The changes in HR (I: 88.2 +/- 3.8; II: 75.6 +/- 2.6; III: 72 +/- 3.1 min-1) and RPP (I: 15,800 +/- 900; II: 11,700 +/- 700; III: 11,400 +/- 600) were similar. In 8 of the 20 patients in group III the HR dropped below 60.min-1, but in none of these patients did the BP become instable. CONCLUSIONS. The sympathoadrenergic reaction during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation can be treated by beta-blocking agents, but such therapy is not without risk because of the long half-life and effects of the therapy on other factors such as postoperative loss of intravascular volume. Esmolol is a new, short-acting, cardioselective beta-blocker with a very short plasma distribution time and a elimination half-life of 9.2 min. Thus, the potential risks of beta-blockers due to half-life are minimised. The results of this study show that a dangerous increase in BP and HR with increased myocardial oxygen consumption can be prevented by a single bolus, and better by a double bolus of 100 mg esmolol. Although bradycardia with HR below 50.min-1 in 8 patients might indicate a risk of cardiac instability, the systolic BP did not fall below 100 mm Hg, and the episode of bradycardia was so short that there was no risk to the patients.}

   Abstract={Although limited numbers of elderly subjects have occasionally been included in population-based studies, only a few studies have been conducted specifically on elderly hypertensives, and practically none at a population level. We studied 655 hypertensive subjects from a cohort of 2,254 elderly subjects. The intervention consisted of the creation of a Hypertension Outpatients' Clinic under our auspices but with complete co-operation from general practitioners, randomizing the identified hypertensive patients into pre-established therapeutic drug regimens, and early follow-up recording of mortality for 7 years. The drugs used were clonidine (n = 61), nifedipine (n = 146) and the fixed combination of atenolol+chlorthalidone (n = 144); 304 subjects underwent "free therapy" by their personal physicians without any special intervention. There were 1,404 normotensive subjects. Overall 7-year follow-up mortality was 34.9% in the hypertensive subjects receiving "free therapy", 22.5% in those receiving "special care", and 24.2% in the normotensives. Cardiovascular mortality was respectively 23.7%, 12.2%, and 12.0%. Overall and cardiovascular annual cumulative mortality were significantly lower in the < special therapy > than in the < free therapy > group. The fixed combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone reduced mortality below that of the normotensives, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.}

   Abstract={The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) is a multicentre, open, randomised, controlled trial. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of active treatment on stroke incidence in hypertensive patients over the age of 80 years. Secondary end-points include total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Entry criteria include a sustained sitting systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219mm Hg plus a sustained sitting diastolic pressure of 95 to 109mm Hg. Also required is a standing systolic blood pressure of at least 140mm Hg. Patients must give their informed consent, and be free of congestive heart failure requiring treatment, gout, renal failure or a recent cerebral haemorrhage. Patients are to be randomised to 3 groups-(i) no treatment; (ii) treatment with a diuretic [bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide)]; or (iii) treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril). Starting dosage for bendroflumethiazide and lisinopril is 2.5 mg/day. In order to achieve goal sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (< 150/80 mm Hg), a doubling of the dosage is allowed. Furthermore, slow release diltiazem (120 mg/day increasing to 240 mg/day if required) may be added to the medication of the actively treated groups. These drugs have been chosen as inexpensive and appropriate representatives of their therapeutic classes. 700 patients in each group (a total of 2100) will be sufficient to detect a 40% difference in cerebrovascular events between no treatment and active treatment (alpha = 0.01, 1-beta = 0.90). These numbers will also detect a difference in total mortality of 25% and in cardiovascular mortality of 35%. The pilot phase of the trial has been started with support from the British Heart Foundation. Centres which are interested in taking part should contact C.J. Bulpitt or any of the other authors.}

Patients were randomized to receive either cilazapril 2.5-5 mg or atenolol 25-100 mg per day per day. Blood pressure before treatment was 147/99 and 148/99 mmHg in both groups respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 132/86 and 131/85 mmHg in both groups of patients respectively. Treatment for one year with cilazapril resulted in a reduction in the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries (150-400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal biopsies from 7.5 +/- 0.3% before treatment to 6.3 +/- 0.2% 1 year later (p < 0.05), still slightly but significantly larger (p < 0.05) than the media/lumen ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive controls (5.1 +/- 0.3%). In arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with treatment (8.0 +/- 0.6% before and 8.1 +/- 0.5% after 1 year of treatment). Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients, but were unchanged in those taking atenolol. Relaxation in response to acetylcholine of norepinephrine pre-contracted arteries was still significantly reduced after one year (< 0.05) in comparison to those of normotensive patients in the patients treated with atenolol, whereas they were not in those who had received cilazapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

Fasting venous levels of thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and leukotriene C4 were measured by radioimmunoassay. Bepridil decreased heart rate responses to daily activities during ambulatory monitoring, and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the median frequency and duration of silent myocardial ischemic episodes (from 5.5 to 0 events/48 hours and from 86 to 0 minutes/48 hours respectively). Bepridil significantly decreased the blood pressure heart rate product at peak exercise and significantly prolonged the mean exercise tolerance time (from 456.6 to 527.0 second). Bepridil also significantly decreased the plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and leukotriene C4 at rest. These results suggest that bepridil may reduce silent myocardial ischemic episodes either by the reduction of cardiac oxygen demand during daily activities and exercise stress, or by controlling coronary and systemic vasomotor tone. The drug also has a salutary effect on eicosanoid metabolism, to which its efficacy on silent myocardial ischemic episodes may be related.}

Significant differences in the rates of deposition of 3H-glucosamine into the extracellular matrix by each group of gingival fibroblasts were demonstrated, suggesting that increased rates of deposition of proteoglycans into the gingival extracellular matrix by fibroblasts should be further investigated as a biologic mechanism for gingival overgrowth.}

All 20 patients had LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of < 40% owing to previous myocardial infarction (MI). Systolic and diastolic function was assessed by standard hemodynamic parameters and pressure-volume relations measured by nuclear stethoscope. All measurements were taken at rest and during ischemia caused by right atrial pacing. Both systolic and diastolic parameters improved equally with isradipine and nifedipine. LVEF and cardiac output (CO) increased owing to peripheral vasodilatation. A decrease in P/Vmax, indicating a negative inotropic effect, was noted in patients at rest with both medications, but not during pacing-induced ischemia. With either medication, the time constant of relaxation and the end-diastolic elasticity constant decreased during pacing, indicating improvement in diastolic function, probably owing to relief of myocardial ischemia.}

   Abstract={Although coronary thrombosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NQMI), the effects of thrombolytic therapy in these disorders is not clear. Also, the role of routine early coronary arteriography followed by revascularization has not been established.\\ Patients (n = 1473) seen within 24 hours of ischemic chest discomfort at rest, considered to represent unstable angina or NQMI, were randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare (1) TPA versus placebo as initial therapy and (2) an early invasive strategy (early coronary arteriography followed by revascularization when the anatomy was suitable) versus an early conservative strategy (coronary arteriography followed by revascularization if initial medical therapy failed). All patients were treated with bed rest, anti-ischemic medications, aspirin, and heparin. The primary end point for the TPA-placebo comparison (death, myocardial infarction, or failure of initial therapy at 6 weeks) occurred in 54.2% of the TPA-treated patients and 55.5% of the placebo-treated patients (P = NS). Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction after randomization (reinfarction in NQMI patients) occurred more frequently in TPA-treated patients (7.4%) than in placebo-treated patients (4.9%, P = .04, Kaplan-Meier estimate). Four intracranial hemorrhages occurred in the TPA-treated group versus none in the placebo-treated group (P = .06). The end point for the comparison of the two strategies (death, myocardial infarction, or an unsatisfactory symptom-limited exercise stress test at 6 weeks) occurred in 18.1% of patients assigned to the early conservative strategy and 16.2% of patients assigned to the early invasive strategy (P = NS). In the latter, the average length of initial hospitalization, incidence of rehospitalization within 6 weeks, and days of rehospitalization all were significantly lower.\\ In the overall trial, patients with unstable angina and NQMI were managed with low rates of mortality (2.4%) and myocardial infarction or reinfarction (6.3%) at the time of the 6-week visit. These results can be achieved using either an early conservative or early invasive strategy, the latter resulting in a reduced incidence of days of hospitalization and of rehospitalization and in the use of antianginal drugs. The addition of a thrombolytic agent is not beneficial and may be harmful.}

To study the pharmacokinetics of both drugs, tolerability and antitumor activity in relation to the MDR1 expression in tumor tissue.\\ Sixteen colorectal cancer patients entered the study. Bepridil was administered by central venous catheter as 5-mg/kg bolus over 30 minutes, followed by 12 mg/kg for 12 hours and 5 mg/kg for 24 hours. Vinblastine 5 mg/m2 was administered as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus 24.5 hours after the start of bepridil. MDR1/P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression was assessed in 14 tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and RNase protection assay.\\ The bepridil plasma level was greater than 2 mumol/L at the time of vinblastine administration in all patients investigated. At the dose used in the study, bepridil produced a QTc-prolongation more than 50 ms, which prevented further dose escalation. However, cardiac toxicity was asymptomatic in all treated patients, and other side effects were mild. MDR1/Pgp expression was positive in nine of 14 cases. Of fifteen patients assessable for response, one complete remission of 8 months' duration and 14 progressions were observed. The responding patient attained complete remission again when re-treated on progression with vinblastine alone.\\ Bepridil plasma concentrations needed in vitro to modulate MDR could be achieved in this study with tolerable toxicity; however, despite most tumors being MDR1/Pgp-positive, no response was obtained that could be attributed to the drug combination. Mechanisms of drug resistance other than MDR are probably implicated in drug resistance of colorectal cancer.}

In order to confirm this hypothesis, a randomised trial was undertaken involving a 5 day comparison of bepridil at the dose of 300 mg/day after a loading dose (900 mg on D1, 500 mg on D2 and D3) with diltiazem 360 mg/day in 277 patients: 210 men and 67 women, with a mean age of 62.1 +/- 9.5, suffering from unstable angina confirmed by an ECG during symptomatic events showing reversible ST depression. A continuous 72 hour ECG record was obtained in 82 patients. Because of 69 inclusion errors, only 208 patients provided evaluable data (110 with bepridil and 98 with diltiazem), including 55 with continuous ECGs. Mortality (4.5% bepridil v. 3.1% diltiazem) and premature treatment terminations for therapeutic inefficacy (4.5% bepridil v. 7.1% diltiazem), myocardial infarction (3.6% bepridil v. 3% diltiazem), adverse events (3.6% bepridil v. 3% diltiazem) or at the patient's request (0.9% bepridil) were similar between the 2 groups. Efficacy regarding angina was similar, with 18.2% recurrences with bepridil and 21.4% with diltiazem during the first 72 hours, persisting without any difference beyond 72 hours. Resulting treatment adjustments concerning nitrates were identical in the 2 groups. Among the 55 patients with an evaluable continuous ECG (27 bepridil and 28 diltiazem, NS), 18 had recurrent ischemic episodes (9 bepridil and 9 diltiazem), 72.2% of which were clinically silent. Their total number, total duration and maximum amplitude of ST depression were similar in the 2 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

   Abstract={To evaluate the efficacy of diltiazem in preventing restenosis after balloon angioplasty (PTCA).\\ Eighty-nine patients who were undergone to successful PTCA, were divided them in 2 groups (G): A) 44 patients (50%) who received diltiazem (180 mg tid) immediately after PTCA and were kept on it for 6 months); B) 45 patients (50%) who received placebo. Fifty two lesions were dilated in GA and 54 in GB. Patients were excluded from analysis for several reasons, including: necessity of diltiazem or others calcium channel blockers use; heart failure, bradicardia, AV block of any degree, PTCA to chronic total occlusion, ostial lesions and AMI less than 30 days prior to PTCA. Patients were randomized to either the active drug or placebo in a double blind fashion. Restenosis was defined as a 50% lesion. Patients underwent late angiography either at 6 months or sooner if clinically indicated.\\ Both G were similar to age > 70 years (A = 7% vs B = 4%-p = NS), sex (A = 13% vs B = 11%-p = NS), stable angina (A = 43% vs B = 51%), unstable angina (A = 57% vs B = 49%-p = NS) and single vessel (A = 91% vs B = 87%-p = NS) or multivessel (A = 9% vs B = 13%-p = NS) PTCA. We studied 39/44 (89%) patients in GA and 43/45 (96%) in GB (p = NS). We observed restenosis in 17/39 (43%) in GA and 16/43 (37%) in GB (p = NS). The restenosis rate per lesion was 39% in GA and 31% in GB (p = NS).\\ Diltiazem was ineffective in the prevention of restenosis following PTCA.}

Single doses of benazepril hydrochloride (10-mg tablet) and amlodipine besylate (tablet equivalent to 5 mg amlodipine) were administered alone or in combination according to a three-way, Latin-Square, randomized cross-over design. Serial blood samples were collected following each administration for the determination of benazepril and its active metabolite benazeprilat and amlodipine. The mean values of AUC (0-4 h), Cmax and Tmax for benazepril given as combination versus given alone were 161 vs 140 ng.h.ml-1, 168 vs 149 ng.ml-1, and 0.5 vs 0.6 h. The mean values of AUC (0-24 h), Cmax and Tmax for benazeprilat after benazepril given as combination versus given alone were 1470 vs 1410 ng.h.ml-1, 292 vs 257 ng.ml-1, and 1.7 vs 1.5 h.

   Pages="101--108",
   Abstract={Rapid, reliable and safe reestablishment of sinus rhythm is the major aim of pharmacologic treatment in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. The mainstay of therapy in this arrhythmia has been quinidine. More recently, amiodarone was shown in noncomparitive studies to be superior to class IA agents under certain conditions. In 40 patients with atrial fibrillation persisting for 4 weeks up to 2 years, the efficacy and safety of either quinidine and verapamil (days 1 to 3, quinidine 1,500 mg/day; days 4 to 6, quinidine 1,500 mg+verapamil 240 mg/day) or amiodarone therapy (days 1 to 3, amiodarone 1,200 mg/day intravenously; days 4 to 14, amiodarone 800 mg/day orally) were randomly examined. Responders continued on their effective medication for 3 months. Thereafter, all patients were treated with a fixed regimen of quinidine (480 mg/day) plus verapamil (240 mg/day) for up to 2 years. During atrial fibrillation, quinidine reduced mean ventricular cycle length by 40 ms (-5%), quinidine and verapamil increased mean cycle length by 57 ms (8%) and amiodarone by 192 ms (28%, p < 0.01). In addition, quinidine and verapamil had a characteristic "rate-smoothing" effect on atrioventricular conduction during atrial fibrillation. The rhythm was converted to sinus rhythm after quinidine in 5 (25%) of 20 patients and after the combination of quinidine and verapamil in 11 (55%) of 20 patients. Amiodarone restored sinus rhythm in 12 (60%) of 20 patients. Overall, a shorter duration of atrial fibrillation (p < 0.05) and a smaller left atrial size (p < 0.01) were predictive of successful conversion of the arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

   Abstract={The long-term effect of calcium channel blockers on chronic heart failure is disappointing, probably because of reflex sympathetic activation through arterial vasodilation. However, nilvadipine may be beneficial for treatment of chronic heart failure since this drug has minimal effects on sympathetic activation. In this study, the effects of 12-week administration of nilvadipine or placebo on symptoms of heart failure and cardiac function were investigated in 23 patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure in a double-blind trial. The patients were randomly assigned to either a nilvadipine group (16 mg daily) or a placebo group. Intergroup comparisons did not show significant differences in any parameters. Serious adverse effects were not observed during the study. Thus, this study failed to show any beneficial effect of nilvadipine in the long-term treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. We conclude that the long-term administration of nilvadipine (16 mg daily) is neither effective nor harmful in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.}

   Abstract={Pulmonary vascular response to the inhalation of various concentrations of oxygen (FIO2) was studied under basal conditions and after nicardipine in 10 patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic bronchitis. Hemodynamic data and blood gases were measured during inhalation of 3 gas mixtures: hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.15), normoxia (FIO2 = 0.21) and hyperoxia (FIO2 = 0.30). Each gas mixture was administered for 20 minutes, initially during an infusion of placebo and then of nicardipine giving a steady plasma concentration of 29 +/- 4 ng/ml. This was obtained by continuous I.V. infusion of 0.06 mg/kg/hour. Under basal conditions with placebo, the heart rate, cardiac output and pulmonary hypertension increased with decreasing concentrations of inhaled oxygen. The systemic blood pressure was unchanged with hypoxia but decreased during hyperoxia. Nicardipine increased the heart rate and the cardiac output but reduced the blood pressure with every inhaled oxygen mixture. The blood pressure was independent of FIO2 and the reduction observed during hyperoxia with placebo no longer occurred with nicardipine. However, the pulmonary hypertension was unaffected. At the dosage used in this study, nicardipine modified the systemic vascular response to oxygen but not the pulmonary vascular response. The vasodilation induced was much greater in the systemic than in the pulmonary circulation. In relation to the absence of significant pulmonary vasodilation, no changes in blood gases, due to a possible pulmonary shunting effect, were observed. At this dosage, nicardipine is ineffective in reducing pulmonary hypertension. However, its systemic hypotensive action may be used in patients with respiratory failure due to chronic bronchitis without deleterious effects on blood gases.}

   Abstract={For the last decade, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) has been the best available standard of care for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), based on equivalent therapeutic results with other multiagent chemotherapy accompanied by lower costs and lesser toxicity. However, only 40-45% of these patients are cured with CHOP. New treatment strategies have been employed, including the addition of Rituximab to CHOP in elderly patients; dose escalation using granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor; overcoming the multidrug resistance phenotype with infusional chemotherapeutic regimens and use of some newer agents. Furthermore, the International Prognostic Factor index (IPI) has permitted identification of subsets of patients with large variations in prognosis, allowing prognosis specific therapy to be tested. There is now accumulating evidence that the clinical behavior of certain NHL can be profiled by the expression of certain molecular markers, which will undoubtedly play a role in the development of new prognostic models that may refine our ability to identify poor-risk patients. Regardless, there is still significant opportunity for improving survival in large cell lymphomas.}

   Abstract={Cardiac complications are the leading cause of death after noncardiac surgery. Despite theoretical benefits, calcium channel blockers (CCB) are not widely used in the perioperative setting. This systematic review assessed the efficacy of CCBs during noncardiac surgery. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, PubMed, and reference lists were searched without language restriction for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating CCBs during noncardiac surgery. Two reviewers independently abstracted data on death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Treatment effects were calculated as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eleven studies (1007 patients) were included. CCBs significantly reduced ischemia (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.80; P = 0.004) and SVT (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37-0.72; P < 0.0001). CCBs were associated with trends towards reduced death and MI. In post hoc analyses, CCBs significantly reduced death/MI (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.86; P = 0.02) and major morbid events (MME), defined as death, MI, or CHF (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.89; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, diltiazem significantly reduced ischemia, SVT, death/MI, and MMEs. This meta-analysis shows CCBs significantly reduced ischemia, SVT, and combined end-points in the setting of noncardiac surgery. The majority of these benefits are attributable to diltiazem, suggesting the need for further evaluation of this drug in a large RCT.}

   Abstract={Preterm delivery is the leading factor causing neonatal mortality and morbidity. We have conducted a PubMed literature search to obtain an update on the etiology, diagnostic problems and therapeutic considerations of preterm delivery. Approximately 5-10% of all births are premature. Preterm labor is associated with preterm rupture of membranes, cervical incompetence, polyhydramnion, fetal and uterine anomalies, infections, social factors, stress, smoking, heavy work and other risk factors. The diagnosis is made on the patients presenting symptoms, clinical findings and of progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix. Biochemical markers of preterm delivery are of minor importance in daily clinical work. Measurement of the cervix, however, is a practical and valuable tool to predict preterm delivery. Cervical cerclage can be useful in selected cases. Antibiotics may help to prevent preterm labor in cases of known etiologic agents (e.g. preterm rupture of membranes and urinary infection). The use of tocolytic agents such as beta-sympathetic receptor stimulators can be advocated for a few days. There is evidence that their long-term use is not beneficial and could even be harmful to the fetus. Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and a new selective oxytocin receptor antagonist, atosiban, appear to be as effective as beta-sympathomimetic drugs on uterine contractions with fewer side-effects. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors such as indomethacin may prevent uterine contractions and can be used prior to the 32nd week of pregnancy. A single course of corticosteroid treatment in two doses of 12 mg betamethasone or 6 mg of dexamethasone is important for the prevention of respiratory distress between the 24th and 34th weeks of pregnancy. Multiple doses may be harmful and should be avoided. In these cases management should depend on gestation age (fetal maturity). Uterine contractions after 34 weeks' gestation are not an indication for tocolytic treatment.}

   Abstract={Chronic anal fissures are associated with a persistent hypertonia and spasm of the internal anal sphincter. Classic treatment is surgical sphincterotomy to reduce the anal tone and eliminate sphincteric spasm. However, concerns have been raised about the incidence of fecal incontinence after surgery. Therefore, pharmacological means to treat chronic anal fissures have been explored.\\ We conducted a literature review on MEDLINE database.\\ All treatments address the anomaly of a high anal pressure. Several studies have investigated the effect of topical glyceryl trinitrate ointment. Healing rates range from 30% to 86%. Therapy is limited because of a high incidence of moderate to severe headaches in up to 84% of patients. Comparable results are observed after injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter (43-96%). Minor incontinence for flatus and soiling has been reported in up to 12% of patients. Further pharmacological approaches including treatment via calcium channel blockade and treatment with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists are still at a developmental stage.\\ Topical glyceryl trinitrate ointment and injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter are advocated as the first-line treatment for chronic anal fissure. Lateral sphincterotomy should be offered to patients with relapse and therapeutic failure of prior pharmacological treatment.}

The end point of the study was healing within a predetermined period (6 months). Variables assessed included demographic data (age, gender), symptoms associated with the fissure, duration of treatment, percentage of healing, untoward effects of treatment, pain scores, duration of follow-up, recurrence, and need for complementary means of treatment. Descriptive data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation and quantal data as percentage. Inference analysis was performed using the Student's t-test for the descriptive data and the chi-squared or Fisher's exact test for nominal variables.\\ No significant differences were recorded with regard to age, gender, symptoms associated with the fissure, or duration of treatment. Healing rate was higher (P < 0.04) with nifedipine (89 percent) as compared with glyceryl trinitrate (58 percent). Treatment side effects (headache, flushing) were more frequent (P < 0.01) with glyceryl trinitrate (40 percent) as compared with nifedipine (5 percent). Pain scores were significantly lower (P < 0.03) on completion of treatment in both groups (3.2 in glyceryl trinitrate and 3.4 in nifedipine vs. 6.2 and 6.1, respectively), but did not differ between the two groups. Recurrence occurred in 31 percent of patients treated with glyceryl trinitrate and 42 percent of those treated with nifedipine after a mean period of 18 +/- 3 weeks and 12 +/- 4 weeks, respectively.\\ Topical application of nifedipine for management of chronic anal fissure was more effective and had fewer side effects than topical glyceryl trinitrate.

This is thought to improve anal mucosal blood flow and promote healing of the fissure. This study reports the use of topical diltiazem in patients with chronic anal fissures that have failed previous treatment with topical 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).\\ Forty-seven patients with chronic anal fissure who had previously failed at least one course of topical GTN were recruited prospectively from a single centre. Patients were instructed to apply 2 cm (approximately 0.7 g) of 2% diltiazem cream to the anal verge twice daily for eight weeks. Symptoms of pain, bleeding and itching were recorded on a linear analogue score prior to starting the cream and then repeated at 2 weekly intervals. Patients were asked to report side-effects throughout the study period. Healing of the fissure was assessed after 8 weeks of treatment.\\ Forty-six patients completed treatment; of these, 22 had healed fissures (48%). Ten of the 24 patients with persistent fissures were symptomatically improved and wished no further treatment. Of the 14 patients who remained symptomatic, one was given a repeat course of 0.2% glyceryl trinitrate with subsequent healing of the fissure, 10 were recruited into an ongoing study involving injections of botulinum toxin into the internal anal sphincter and three were referred for surgery.\\ This study shows that topical 2% diltiazem is an effective and safe treatment for chronic anal fissure in patients who have failed topical 0.2% GTN. The need for sphincterotomy can be avoided in up to 70% of cases.}

   Abstract={The aim of this study was to compare prospectively diltiazem with GTN ointment in the treatment of anal fissure.\\ Of 43 outpatients with chronic anal fissure, 22 patients were randomized to topical diltiazem (2%) ointment and 21 patients to glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) (0.5%) ointment twice daily for 8 weeks. During the course of treatment each patient was seen three times. Side-effects and healing were recorded.\\ Healing occurred in 19 of 22 patients treated with diltiazem and 18 of 21 patients were cured with GTN (P = 0.95). Those who were treated with nitroglycerin ointment developed headache and dizziness developed after GTN in 33.3% of cases while no patient had any side-effects after diltiazem.\\ Diltiazem and glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) were equally effective in healing anal fissure but the former resulted in fewer side-effects.}

   Abstract={This study was designed to show the effects of sublingually administered nifedipine and captopril on middle cerebral arterial blood flow during hypertensive crisis in the emergency department.\\ Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) was performed on the patients fulfilling the criteria (15 patients given captopril, 13 patients given nifedipine, mean (+/-SD) age 56 +/- 11 and 54 +/- 10 years, respectively). Then, patients were randomized into sublingually administered captopril or nifedipine groups and after the drug administration, TCD was repeated. Initial systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 200 +/- 21/125 +/- 21 mmHg in the captopril group and 199 +/- 17/ 123 +/- 20 mmHg in the nifedipine group. There was no significant difference between antihypertensive effects of the drugs after initiation of treatment. Before the treatment with captopril, middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow velocities (Vm) and pulsatility index (PI) were 76.74 +/- 6.38 cm/s and 1.18 +/- 0.09, respectively. The values after the treatment with captopril were 78.21 +/- 5.24cm/s (p < 0.05) and 0.92 +/- 0.08 (p < 0.001), respectively. Before the treatment with nifedipine, Vm and PIs were 64.73 +/- 5.11 cm/s and 1.14 +/- 0.18, respectively. After the treatment with nifedipine, Vm was 60.04 +/- 5.36 cm/s (p < 0.01) and PI was 1.21 +/- 0.09 (p < 0.01).\\ After treatment with captopril, PIs were decreased to normal limits but in the group treated with nifedipine, PIs increased to more pathological values. These results showed that we should reconsider the use of nifedipine in the emergency departments as an antihypertensive agent in hypertensive attack treatment.}

   Abstract={In some of the patients undergoing haemodialysis, (HD) resistance might develop against recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) used for treatment of anaemia. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in HD patients have been suggested to contribute to anaemia as well by inhibiting erythropoiesis. Our purpose in this study is to investigate whether or not losartan, an angiotensin II (ATII) receptor antagonist, is causing rHuEPO resistance.\\ In this prospective study of 12 months, we compared the effects of high dose losartan (100 mg/day) and amlodipine (10 mg/day) on rHuEPO requirement in 40 hypertensive patients receiving rHuEPO for more than 12 months on maintenance HD. Twenty normotensive rHuEPO dependent patients served as control group. Iron deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, aluminium intoxication, infections and inflammations were excluded in all patients.\\ The mean haemoglobin level was found >8 g/dl in all groups. The mean weekly rHuEPO dose increased in the losartan group (p<0.0001 vs before) and remained constant in the other groups. No significant differences were found with PTH, iron status, aetiologies of renal failure in all groups.\\ High-dose losartan increases rHuEPO requirement and should be reserved for dialysis patients with hypertension uncontrollable with other antihypertensive medications.}

   Abstract={The pathophysiology of the scorpion envenoming syndrome is described with emphasis on the body systems commonly affected. Concepts of the mechanisms underlying venom action, as can be explained by the recently discovered effects on ionic channels, are discussed. A protocol for the treatment of scorpion stings based mainly on antivenom therapy was applied nationwide in Saudi Arabia. A list of drugs with alternatives was specified to be used in adjunctive therapy, when required. Analysis of the outcome from 1,033 cases at Al-Baha region, 791 cases at Al-Qassim region and more than 2,000 cases from 12 central and specialist hospitals in the Central Province, Saudi Arabia gave impressive results. The incidence of severe venom toxicity following antivenom administration was almost negligible. The period of stay in the hospital was reduced. The early reaction to antivenom administration was lower than expected the severity of the reaction consisting mainly of skin rashes, urticaria, wheezing and bronchial hypersensitivity, but no anaphylaxis. About 13.8% of the victims had been previously treated with antivenom but only 1.7% of the patients showed positive skin tests. This might be due to the low protein content of the antivenom and the action of the venom in releasing massive amounts of catecholamines.}

   Abstract={Preterm birth is the major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity in the developed world. Where there are no contraindications to their use, tocolytics can improve neonatal survival rates by approximately 3% per day between 23 and 27 weeks gestation with a concomitant reduction in morbidity. The ultimate aim of tocolytic therapy is to prolong pregnancy until growth and maturation is complete, but even short-term delay may enable the administration of antepartum glucocorticoids to reduce hyaline membrane disease or to arrange transfer to a center with neonatal intensive care facilities. Both of these have been shown to reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity. Until recently, none of the currently used tocolytics, whether licensed or unlicensed, were developed specifically for the inhibition of preterm labor and consequently, they exhibit various potentially serious side-effects. As a result of the recent licensing of the oxytocin antagonist, atosiban, developed for the treatment of preterm labor and due to its high utero-specificity, obstetricians have experienced an advance in their options for the management of spontaneous preterm labor.}

   Abstract={To evaluate literature relating to cardiac QT prolongation and the use of antipsychotic drugs.\\ Literature searches of EMBASE, Medline, PsychLIT were performed in December 2001 and reference sections of retrieved papers scrutinized for further relevant reports.\\ The Cardiac QTc interval is difficult to measure precisely or accurately but appears to be a useful predictor of risk of dysrhythmia (specifically torsade de pointes) and sudden death. It is less clear that drug-induced QTc prolongation gives rise to similar risks but data are emerging, linking antipsychotic use to increased cardiac mortality. Many antipsychotics have been clearly associated with QTc prolongation. Methodological considerations arguably preclude assuming that any antipsychotic is free of the risk of QTc prolongation and dysrhythmia.\\ Available data do not allow assessment of relative or absolute risk of dysrhythmia or sudden death engendered by antipsychotics but caution is advised. Risk of dysrhythmia can very probably be reduced by careful prescribing of antipsychotics in low doses in simple drug regimens which avoid metabolic interactions. Electrocardiographic monitoring may also help to reduce risk but review by specialist cardiologist may be necessary.}

   Abstract={Insulin resistance (IR) in chronic renal failure (CRF) is well-known. In this randomized-controlled study, we aimed to compare the effect of doxazosin and amlodipine on IR in patients with CRF. Fifteen patients with CRF (male/female: 5/10, mean age: 46 +/- 13 years) and 9 controls (male/female: 3/6, mean age: 35 +/- 8 years) were included. Patients and controls had no family history of diabetes mellitus. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was calculated as a marker of IR. Patients were grouped randomly to doxazosin (n = 8; 2-4 mg/day) and amlodipine (n = 7; 5-10 mg/day) arms. Baseline biochemical analysis (fasting serum glucose, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, cholesterol and cholesterol subgroups) and parameters related with insulin metabolism (insulin, C peptide, HOMA) were similar between amlodipine and doxazosin groups. There was no difference in age, gender and body mass index among study groups. The follow-up time was 12 weeks. Patients with CRF had higher HOMA (1.83 +/- 0.55 vs 1.00 +/- 0.36, p = 0.001), fasting insulin (8.06 +/- 1.98 vs 4.46 +/- 1.31 IU/l, p < 0.001) and serum triglyceride levels (197 +/- 136 vs 112 +/- 67 mg/dl, p = 0.04) as compared to controls. Serum HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in patients with CRF than controls (40 +/- 10 vs 57 +/- 14 mg/dl, p = 0.02). HOMA significantly decreased after doxazosin (1.91 +/- 0.45 vs 1.41 +/- 0.21, p = 0.02), however, no difference was found after amlodipine. Also, fasting insulin levels were decreased after a 12-week doxazosin therapy from 8.17 +/- 1.22 vs 6.58 +/- 0.84 IU/l, p = 0.02), but no change was seen after amlodipine. Lipid parameters did not significantly change during the study period in 2 groups. No adverse effect requiring drug discontinuation was observed during the 12-week period in the study groups. In conclusion, doxazosin decreases IR in patients with CRF, whereas amlodipine has no effect. This may be of advantage in the treatment of hypertension in this group of patients for preventing some long-term complication of IR.}

   Abstract={A major limitation of the rotational atherectomy (RA) procedure is the occurrence of the no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon and the optimal strategy is still evolving. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of nicorandil, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel opener, on no-reflow in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of nicorandil on no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon during RA procedures. Sixty-one patients who underwent RA of complex coronary lesions were randomly divided into 2 groups: (i) nicorandil cocktail (n=24 patients, 37 lesions) and (ii) verapamil cocktail (n=37 patients, 63 lesions). In each group, the drug cocktail mixed with pressurized saline was infused through the 4Fr Teflon sheath of the rotablator system during the RA procedure. In the nicorandil group, the drug cocktail consisted of 24 mg of nicorandil, 5 mg of nitroglycerin, and 10,000 U of heparin. In the verapamil group, the drug cocktail consisted of 10 mg of verapamil, 5 mg of nitroglycerin, and 10,000 U of heparin. Baseline and procedure characteristics did not differ between the 2 groups. RA was performed successfully, and death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or emergency coronary artery bypass surgery did not occur in any patients. The no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon was observed in 11/63 (17.4%) lesions of the verapamil group, but in only 1/37 (2.7%) lesions of the nicorandil group (p=0.03). No untoward complications were observed during nicorandil infusion. These data indicate that the intracoronary continuous infusion of nicorandil during RA procedures is easy and safe, and prevents no-reflow/slow flow phenomenon more effectively than infusion of verapamil.}

The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of gingival overgrowth in a group of children post liver transplantation and to compare gingival overgrowth in children receiving FK506 with those receiving cyclosporin.\\ Seventy-nine children (aged 15-196 months) undergoing liver transplantation at Birmingham Children's Hospital between October 1998 and October 2000 were studied. Gingival overgrowth was assessed in a blinded fashion and scored in a previously validated manner. Gingival overgrowth scores of the patients on each immunosuppressant drug were then compared.\\ Fifty-two patients were treated with cyclosporin and 27 treated with tacrolimus. Eighteen children were also receiving nifedipine (also known to cause gingival overgrowth) and were considered separately. Of the 41 children receiving cyclosporin alone, 26 exhibited gingival overgrowth compared to zero of 20 patients receiving tacrolimus alone. Those children treated with immunosuppression plus nifedipine developed gingival overgrowth, however, this was much less marked in the tacrolimus group.\\ Tacrolimus, unlike cyclosporin, is not associated with gingival overgrowth when used for immunosuppression following liver transplantation in children, and may be the drug of choice for children.}

Genetic testing and new, more sensitive catecholamine tests are allowing better, earlier diagnosis of affected patients. Some patients with small tumors deemed nonfunctional by traditional methods may be safely observed until function is demonstrated.

The data were compared with those using diltiazem, nifedipine and amlodipine under identical conditions in blood from eight healthy volunteers (four males, four females; aged 23-36 years) and eight hypertensive patients (four males, four females; aged 31-46 years). Semotiadil showed a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro with all the agents examined. Using the various aggregation-inducing agents, the dose-dependent inhibitory action was comparable for all the compounds tested. The antiaggregatory potency was in the order diltiazem, semotiadil, amlodipine and nifedipine. The incubation period did not significantly affect the antiaggregatory effect. No difference between platelets derived from healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients was noted. These findings indicate potent antiplatelet activity of the new calcium antagonist semotiadil.}

   Abstract={Many children with hypertension, particularly those with new-onset hypertension related to glomerulonephritis, organ transplantation, or other forms of secondary hypertension, require treatment with a short-acting antihypertensive in order to quickly achieve blood pressure (BP) control. We administered isradipine, a short-acting, second-generation calcium antagonist, to 72 such children. Retrospective data collection was undertaken to determine the effects of isradipine treatment. The mean age of children treated with isradipine was 74+/-55 months (mean+/-SD). Nearly all of these children had secondary hypertension and were initially treated as hospital inpatients for newly diagnosed hypertension. Mean isradipine dose was 0.36+/-0.17 mg/kg per day, with no significant variation in dose according to patient age. Isradipine was administered three times per day in most instances, but 21% of the time it was administered four times per day. An extemporaneous isradipine suspension was used in 62% of treatment courses. BP control was achieved with isradipine alone in 38 children; the remainder received isradipine in combination with additional antihypertensives. Comparison of pre-treatment BP with BP obtained 8+/-9 days later demonstrated a significant BP reduction with isradipine treatment, with a mean reduction of 14+/-13 mmHg for systolic BP and 13+/-15 mmHg for diastolic BP. There was no effect of isradipine treatment on heart rate. Adverse effects occurred in 9.5% of treatment courses, and included headache, flushing, dizziness, and tachycardia. We conclude that isradipine successfully lowers BP in hypertensive children with secondary forms of hypertension. Use of isradipine suspension allows infants and young children to be treated as readily as older children.}

This is a retrospective study of 24 children with clinical suspicion of renovascular disease who underwent CTRA examinations. CTRA demonstrated surgically correctable etiology of hypertension in 38% of the patients [5 with renal artery stenosis (RAS) and 4 with renal pathology]. In 5 patients, CTRA findings of RAS were confirmed by catheter angiogram. CTRA missed RAS in 1 patient in whom catheter angiogram showed beaded narrowing of the renal artery. All 6 patients with RAS had resolution of hypertension immediately after angioplasty or surgery. One patient with diffuse renal artery stenosis had an ipsilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney. In this patient hypertension resolved spontaneously as the dysplastic kidney shrunk in size. Seven patients had a renal etiology for hypertension. In 3 of these patients hypertension resolved after nephrectomy. Malignant hypertension in the 4th patient with reflux nephropathy was controlled medically after she underwent bilateral ureteral reimplantation. The remaining 3 patients with renal etiology were managed medically. We found that the etiology was central for hypertension in 4 patients with brain abnormalities, obesity in 1 overweight patient, essential hypertension in 4 patients, and thoracic aorta coarctation in 1 patient. Our study showed that in all except 1 instance CTRA could diagnose a surgically correctable cause for hypertension. CTRA provided useful information for the management of pediatric hypertension in all our patients.}

Postacyclin by continuous infusion has been a major advance in the therapy of primary pulmonary hypertension and has prolonged survival and delayed the need for lung transplantation. Bosentan, an endothelin receptor blocking agent is the first oral medication approved for the therapy of pulmonary hypertension.}

   Abstract={Both topical diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, and glyceryl trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, lower anal pressure and heal two-thirds of chronic anal fissures. This study evaluated the efficacy of diltiazem for fissures that failed to heal with glyceryl trinitrate.\\ Consecutive patients with persistent chronic fissures despite treatment with 0.2 percent glyceryl trinitrate ointment underwent anal manometry before and for 1 hour after application of 700 mg of 2 percent diltiazem gel to the distal anal canal. Patients applied diltiazem twice daily for eight weeks or until the fissure had healed. At fortnightly review, fissure healing was assessed, and side effects were noted. Patients scored symptoms of pain, bleeding, and irritation using linear visual analog scales at the initial and follow-up visits.\\ In 39 patients (13 males; median age, 42 (range, 20- 80) years), topical 2 percent diltiazem gel lowered anal resting pressure by 20 percent from a median of 93 to 74 cm H2O (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon), and fissures healed in 19 (49 percent) within 8 weeks. Before diltiazem, 27 patients (69 percent) had used a complete course of glyceryl trinitrate (0.5 g twice daily for 8 weeks), and 12 (44 percent) of these healed with diltiazem. The remaining 12 patients had discontinued glyceryl trinitrate prematurely or used less because of headaches; 7 (58 percent) of these healed with diltiazem, and 5 (42 percent) did not. Side effects occurred in four patients (10 percent): three reported perianal itching but continued with treatment, and one developed headaches, drowsiness, and mood swings six weeks into treatment and stopped diltiazem at that time.\\ Topical 2 percent diltiazem is effective treatment for glyceryl trinitrate-resistant chronic anal fissures. Side effects, mainly perianal itching, may occur in 10 percent of patients but are generally tolerated.}

   Abstract={We performed a multicentre, phase IV, open-label clinical trial to examine the clinical usefulness of a continuous infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride to control hypertension in 31 patients with acute aortic dissection. Target blood pressure levels were reached within 15 min in 16 patients; in 15-30 min in 10 patients; in 30-45 min in three patients; and in 45-60 min in two patients. Baseline average systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures were 147 +/- 23 mmHg, 82 +/- 18 mmHg and 104 +/- 18 mmHg, respectively, with third-day pressures significantly reduced at 119 +/- 12 mmHg, 69 +/- 9 mmHg and 86 +/- 8 mmHg. Blood pressures after discontinuation of the infusion were not significantly different from those measured on the third day of infusion and no definite adverse effects attributable to the treatment were observed. Nicardipine hydrochloride was both effective and safe at controlling blood pressure in patients with acute aortic dissection.}

   Abstract={We examined the use of intraplaque injection of verapamil for the treatment of Peyronie's disease through its effects on pain, curvature, indentation, sexual function and erectile capacity.\\ A total of 156 men underwent treatment with intraplaque verapamil injection. Patients were assessed objectively, during dynamic penile duplex ultrasound, as well as subjectively using a questionnaire before and after initiation of the treatment protocol. Patients were also stratified by duration of disease before therapy and into 1 of 3 Kelami classification groups based on pretreatment plaque size and severity of curvature. Differences before and after treatment and among the Kelami classification groups were assessed.\\ Of the 140 patients who completed treatment 73 (60%) had an objectively measured decrease in curvature while 79 (62%) reported a subjective decrease in curvature during the followup interview. After treatment 111 (83%) men reported an increase in girth, 107 (80%) an increase in rigidity distal to the plaque and 92 (71%) an improvement in sexual function. Among each Kelami class curvature was objectively measured to decrease in 41%, 68% and 62% of patients in classes I, II and III, respectively. There was no significant difference in response based on duration of disease (60% improvement versus 61% improvement for disease duration of less or greater than 1 year in duration, respectively). Mean followup was 30.4 months (range 10 to 81) and there was no reported recurrence of penile deformity in those men with an initial posttreatment positive response.\\ Verapamil injection of Peyronie's plaques appears to be a clinically effective treatment option for pain and curvature and can contribute to subjective improvement in sexual function and erectile capacity. The low incidence of complications indicates that this therapy is also clinically safe.}

   Abstract={Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) ointment (0 small middle dot2 per cent) has an efficacy of up to 68 per cent in healing chronic anal fissure, but with headache as a major side-effect. Diltiazem hydrochloride (DTZ) cream (2 per cent) is expected to have fewer side-effects.\\ A prospective double-blind randomized two-centre trial requiring at least 26 patients in each group (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.9) was instituted after approval of the local ethics committee, to compare the incidence of side-effects (primary endpoint) with 0.2 per cent GTN ointment and 2 per cent DTZ cream in the treatment of chronic anal fissure. Treatments were applied perianally, twice daily for 6-8 weeks. All patients gave written informed consent.\\ Both groups were comparable in patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Twelve patients violated the protocol, withdrew or did not attend follow-up. There were more side-effects with GTN (21 of 29 patients) than with DTZ (13 of 31) (relative risk (RR) 1.84 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1.11 to 3.04), P = 0.01). In particular, more headaches occurred with GTN (17 of 29 patients) than with DTZ (eight of 31) (RR 2.06 (95 per cent c.i. 1.18 to 3.59), P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in healing and symptomatic improvement rates between patients receiving GTN (25 of 29) and DTZ (24 of 31).\\ DTZ cream caused substantially fewer headaches than GTN ointment. There was no significant difference in the healing or improvement of chronic anal fissure between the treatments. DTZ may be the preferred first-line treatment for chronic anal fissure.}

   Abstract={Pre-eclampsia is one of the most serious and common complications of pregnancy. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, and the vasodilator hydralazine have both been used as antihypertensive agents in this condition. The aim of this study was to determine which of these two agents is the most appropriate antihypertensive in the management of severe pre-eclampsia.\\ One hundred and twenty-six pre-eclamptic patients with a gestational age of more than 20 weeks were randomized to receive either 8 mg nifedipine sublingually or 5-10 mg intravenous hydralazine. Women with a history of heart failure and women receiving antihypertensive treatment during the course of the current pregnancy were excluded. For each patient the following data were recorded; the number of drug administrations, the time needed to control blood pressure, mean urinary output, the time interval between effective control and a new hypertensive crisis after each drug administration and relevant adverse effects in mother or fetus.\\ Effective control of blood pressure was achieved in both treatment arms. Data analysis indicated significantly fewer drug administrations in the nifedipine arm of the study. The time interval before a new hypertensive crisis following initial effective control of blood pressure was significantly longer in the nifedipine group when compared with hydralazine. Effective control of blood pressure was achieved more rapidly in multiparous patients receiving nifedipine (p=0.026). Mean urinary output before and after delivery was greater in the nifedipine arm of the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in other variables. In addition, in neither group were there any serious adverse effects in mother or fetus.\\ Nifedipine is safe and more effective than hydralazine in controlling blood pressure in severe pre-eclampsia. It has the added advantage of being cheaper and more widely available than the latter and is easily administered.}

   Abstract={Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonists may be able to reverse LVH independent to the hypotensive effect in the ESRD setting. Thirty chronically hemodialyzed uremic patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to receive the AT1-R antagonist losartan (n = 10), the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACD) inhibitor enalapril (n = 10), or calcium antagonist amlodipine (n = 10). Left ventricular mass (LVM) index was measured by echocardiography before and 6 months after treatment. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between the three groups. The mean baseline LVM index also did not differ in the three groups. After 6 months of treatment, losartan treatment significantly reduced the LVM index (-24.7 +/- 3.2%) than amlodipine (-10.5 +/- 5.2%) or enalapril (-11.2 +/- 4.1%) therapy. All three groups had a similar decrease in the mean blood pressure with treatment. The plasma angiotensin II concentration increased 5-fold with losartan treatment. In contrast, the plasma angiotension II concentration did not change with enalapril and only increased 2-fold with amlodipine. Thus, the present study indicates that losartan more effectively regresses LVH in patients with ESRD than do enalapril and amlodipine despite a comparable depressor effect between the three drugs.}

   Abstract={Concerns regarding the safety of nifedipine emerged in 1995 with the report of an increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with adult patients receiving short-acting calcium channel blockers. There have been few case reports of adverse events in children. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect on blood pressure (BP) and the incidence of adverse events associated with nifedipine in our pediatric population. We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who received nifedipine. We recorded the dose administered, all BP measurements and all adverse events reported within six hours of a nifedipine dose regardless of the likelihood that those events were related to the nifedipine dose. 1,746 doses of nifedipine in 166 pediatric patients were reviewed. Systolic BP decreased by a mean of 17% and a maximum of 63%. Diastolic BP decreased by a mean of 28% and a maximum of 89%. Adverse events included: a) change in neurologic status, six cases; b) hypotension, two cases; c) oxygen desaturation, 16 cases. Neurologic events occurred in 33% of patients with acute CNS injury and 3.6% of all patients. Short-acting nifedipine is an important and effective oral antihypertensive agent which can be safely used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in children. It should be used with caution in children with acute CNS injury.}

   Abstract={Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors are commonly used in the treatment of hypertensive renal transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the response rate to treatment differs with these drugs in this setting. A single centre, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, comparative study to address the efficacy of controlled release nifedipine or lisinopril in the treatment of hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or =95 mmHg) in cyclosporin (CsA)-treated renal transplant recipients was performed. Recipients were randomised to receive either lisinopril (10 mg once daily) or controlled release nifedipine (30 mg once daily). The dose was doubled on indication. The number of responders (diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg on monotherapy) were addressed during the early post-transplant phase (first 3 months) and during a late post-transplant phase (from 3 to 12 months after renal transplantation) in the same patient population. One hundred and fifty-four patients (nifedipine=78, lisinopril=76) with untreated hypertension (diastolic blood pressure> or =95 mmHg) were randomised within 3 wk after renal transplantation. One hundred and twenty-three patients (nifedipine=69, lisinopril=54) completed the study. Fourteen (20%) nifedipine-treated recipients responded during the early, and 26 (38%) during the late post-operative phase (months 4-12 after renal transplantation). Eleven (20%) lisinopril-treated recipients responded during the early, and 18 (33%) during the late post-transplant phase. Non-responders were, on average, 8.5+/-1.5 kg heavier both in the early phase and after 1 yr of treatment (p<0.01), and 6.1+/-0.9 yr older than responders (p<0.05). In conclusion, these results indicate that both controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril are equally efficient in the treatment of post-transplant hypertension. As monotherapy, both drugs show a "response rate" of 20-38%, depending on time interval after transplantation.}

   Abstract={Although in experimental models of coronary occlusion diltiazem administration has been shown to reduce the degree of stunning and of reperfusion injury, the majority of clinical trials has failed to demonstrate significant benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of diltiazem, administered before coronary reperfusion, on infarct size, residual myocardial viability and recovery of left ventricular function.\\ We studied 90 patients admitted within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. They were immediately randomized to either intravenous diltiazem (10 mg bolus + 10 mg/hour for 3 days) (group 1, n = 43) or placebo (group 2, n = 47) and subsequently treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. All underwent serial echocardiograms upon admission, 4 days post-admission during low-dose dobutamine stress echo, at discharge and after 6 months. We calculated the dysfunction score (1 = hypokinesia, 2 = akinesia, 3 = dyskinesia) on admission and its percent reduction after dobutamine (viability) and at follow-up (recovery). The 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 3 days and coronary angioplasty was performed whenever the residual stenosis was > 60%.\\ Upon admission, there were no differences in age, sex, infarct location and size, degree of ST-segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms and dysfunction score. Creatine kinase peaked early in 70% of patients in both groups; the incidences of recurrent ischemia, infarct-related vessel patency and the need for coronary angioplasty were also similar. The creatine kinase peak was significantly higher in group 2 (2931 +/- 2456 vs 1726 +/- 1004 IU/l, p < 0.05). Conversely, in group 1 the residual viability was significantly higher (51 +/- 23 vs 36 +/- 30% improvement in dysfunction score, p < 0.05) and the early recovery of regional function was significantly greater (35 +/- 34 vs 18 +/- 22% at discharge, p < 0.05). On the other hand, the delayed recovery was not significantly different (15 +/- 29 vs 21 +/- 32% from the time of discharge to 6 months of follow-up).\\ Intravenous diltiazem, started before coronary reperfusion, has beneficial effects on the infarct size, residual viability and recovery of regional function. If confirmed by larger trials, these preliminary results suggest the use of diltiazem as adjunctive therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction and undergoing reperfusion.}

   Abstract={In addition to questions raised about the efficacy of many tocolytics, appropriate concern has been voiced about the safety of these potent drugs. Although some degree of risk for adverse effects with drugs promising a strong therapeutic effect can be accepted, caution needs to be exercised when benefits are marginal or unproven. Unfortunately, some of the tocolytics, most notably the betamimetics and magnesium sulfate, have been found to have considerable potential for adverse maternal cardiovascular and respiratory effects. Although less clearly established, the use of indomethacin appears to be associated with increased fetal and neonatal risks. Concerning magnesium sulfate, in addition to the well-known maternal effects, the accumulating evidence showing an increased frequency of adverse outcomes in the fetus and neonate has led to the recommendations to abandon its use entirely as a tocolytic. Given the limitations of our current state of knowledge, nifedipine would appear to be among the more efficacious and safer tocolytics available to use when properly indicated.}

   Abstract={Iloprost is a stable prostacyclin analogue which has been shown to be effective in the short-term symptomatic treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term cyclic therapy with iloprost in comparison with nifedipine on the skin score, pulmonary function and Raynaud's severity score in patients with SSc and RP.\\ We conducted a 12-month prospective, randomised, parallel-group, blind-observer trial to compare the effects of intravenously infused iloprost (2 ng/kg/min on 5 consecutive days over a period of 8 hours/day and subsequently for 8 hours on one day every 6 weeks) with those of conventional vasodilating therapy with nifedipine (40 mg/day for os) in 46 patients with SSc and RP.\\ At 12 months, iloprost but not nifedipine reduced the skin score (iloprost: from 13.26 +/- 2.05 to 9.26 +/- 1.32, p = 0.002; nifedipine: from 10.83 +/- 2.09 to 12.17 +/- 3.02, p = n.s.; iloprost vs nifedipine: p = 0.016) and the RP severity score (iloprost: from 2.17 +/- 0.2 to 1.22 +/- 0.13, p = 0.02 vs baseline; nifedipine: from 2.08 +/- 0.34 to 1.33 +/- 0.22, p = n.s.). Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), expressed as % of the predicted normal value, worsened significantly in the nifedipine group (from 69.6 +/- 7.4% to 61.5 +/- 6.5%, p = 0.044) and remained stable in patients treated with iloprost (from 53.2 +/- 4.8 to 56.0 +/- 4.6%, iloprost vs nifedipine: p = 0.026).\\ In SSc patients, cyclic intravenous iloprost infusion is able to control vasospastic disease. Our results suggest that it might also act as a disease-modifying agent, as it seems to improve the course of the disease. Further studies principally focused on organ involvement and the natural history of the disease are needed to confirm our results.}

The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) (controlled release nifedipine) in treatment of posttransplant hypertension focusing on changes in LVH.\\ One hundred fifty-four renal transplant recipients presenting with hypertension (diastolic BP> or =95 mmHg) during the first 3 weeks after transplantation were randomized to receive double-blind 30 mg nifedipine or 10 mg lisinopril once daily.\\ One hundred twenty-three patients completed 1 year of treatment. Good quality echocardiographic data were available in 116 recipients (62 nifedipine/54 lisinopril) 2 and 12 months posttransplant. Blood pressure was equally well controlled in the two groups throughout the study (mean systolic/diastolic+/-SD after 1 year: 140+/-16/87+/-8 mmHg with nifedipine and 136+/-17/85+/-8 mmHg with lisinopril). Left ventricular mass index was reduced by 15% (P<0.001) in both groups (from 153+/-43 to 131+/-38 g/m2 with nifedipine and from 142+/-35 to 121+/-34 g/m2 with lisinopril). There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups at baseline or at follow-up.\\ In hypertensive renal transplant recipients with well-controlled blood pressure, there is a regression of left ventricular mass after renal transplantation. The regression of left ventricular mass index is observed to a similar extent in patients treated with lisinopril or nifedipine.}

   Abstract={In adults the calcium antagonist amlodipine given once a day has proved to be an attractive addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium. The present report describes our experience in 43 paediatric outpatients (26 boys and 17 girls, aged between 1.1 and 19, median 9.8 years) with chronic kidney diseases. The patients were given amlodipine for 16 weeks as part of their antihypertensive treatment. Before amlodipine arterial pressure was 150 (142-163)/90 (84-95) mm Hg (median and interquartile range). Six patients withdrew from amlodipine because of oedema, flushing or headache. In the remaining patients amlodipine 7.7 (6.9-9.4) mg/m(2) body surface area once a day significantly decreased arterial pressure by 17 (13-22)/10 (7-13) mm Hg. The efficacy of amlodipine was more pronounced in girls than in boys. No changes in heart rate, body weight and circulating haemoglobin, sodium, potassium and creatinine were noted. In none of the patients circulating potassium, sodium or creatinine changed by more than 0.5 mmol/l, 5 mmol/l respectively 20%. In 11 patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporine the dosage and the trough-level of this agent were stable throughout the trial. In conclusion the present experience in paediatric outpatients with chronic kidney diseases supports the view that amlodipine is an effective and rather well tolerated antihypertensive drug when given once a day.}

   Abstract={Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease adequately during the transition to extrauterine life. Inhaled nitric oxide, a vasodilator that acts selectively on the pulmonary circulation, has revolutionized the treatment of this condition. However, inhaled nitric oxide has not proven effective in all patients, particularly those with congenital diaphragmatic hernias or meconium aspiration syndrome. Furthermore, large clinical trials of inhaled nitric oxide have failed to demonstrate significant differences in mortality between nitric oxide-treated and control infants with PPHN. Other therapeutic approaches to PPHN have been limited by a relative lack of specificity for the pulmonary circulation, and have received much less attention. Pharmacologic approaches, including pulmonary surfactants, prostacyclin, endothelin antagonists, Ca(2+)-channel blockers, magnesium sulfate, and tolazoline, have exhibited varying degrees of efficacy in lowering pulmonary vascular pressures in humans and/or animals. A number of these agents are also effective when used in combination. For example, phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been reported to act synergistically with inhaled nitric oxide. Surfactants also appear to be useful in PPHN, particularly in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, when used in combination with other therapies. Surfactant lavage and other novel therapies may also be effective in combination therapy of meconium aspiration syndrome. Further studies should be directed at defining the optimal therapies in specific clinical settings. Validation of multiple therapeutic modalities for PPHN, including inhaled nitric oxide, will allow for rational, combined vasodilator strategies that are specific for the underlying pathophysiology in each patient.}

   Abstract={Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients are frequently treated with prophylactic nimodipine and undergo invasive monitoring of blood pressure and volume status in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting to decrease the incidence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) and improve functional outcomes. The goal of this study was to examine the incidence of DIND and poor functional outcomes in a consecutive series of SAH patients treated with a different regimen of prophylactic oral diltiazem and limited use of intensive care monitoring.\\ The study involved a consecutive series of 123 aneurysmal SAH patients treated by the senior author who were admitted within 72 hours of hemorrhage and who never received nimodipine or nicardipine. Functional outcomes were graded using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).\\ Of the 123 patients identified, favorable outcomes (GOS 4 and 5) were achieved in 74.8%. The incidence of DIND was 19.5%. Hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional (HHH) therapy was used in 10 patients (8.1%) and no patients were treated for DIND by endovascular means. Seven patients (5.7%) had a poor functional outcome or death because of DIND and two of these were related to complications of HHH therapy. These results were compared to contemporary series of SAH patients managed with other treatment protocols.\\ Functional outcomes of patients treated with a regimen of oral diltiazem, limited use of ICU monitoring and HHH therapy for DIND compare favorably with other contemporary series of SAH patients.}

   Abstract={Chronic anal fissure has traditionally been treated surgically. Initial enthusiasm for chemical sphincterotomy has waned because of poor outcomes with glyceryl trinitrate ointment. In this study the use of topical 2 per cent diltiazem ointment has been investigated as an alternative method of chemical sphincterotomy.\\ A prospective assessment of 71 consecutive patients with a chronic anal fissure treated with 2 per cent topical diltiazem ointment for a median duration of 9 (range 2--16) weeks was performed.\\ Fifty-one patients (75 per cent) experienced healing of the fissure after 2--3 months of treatment with topical diltiazem. Seventeen patients who did not heal were treated for a further 8 weeks with topical diltiazem. Eight of these patients subsequently healed with diltiazem. Fifty-nine of 67 patients who completed follow-up therefore healed on diltiazem ointment. Four patients experienced perianal dermatitis and one patient experienced headaches. No other side-effects were recorded. After a median of 32 (range 14--67) weeks' follow-up following completion of treatment, 27 of 41 patients available remain symptom free. Six of seven patients with recurrent fissure were treated successfully by repeat chemical sphincterotomy.\\ Topical 2 per cent diltiazem ointment used as an agent for chemical sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure offers significant healing rates but does not have a significant side-effect profile, which may aid compliance to treatment. Early recurrences are common but usually amenable to further chemical sphincterotomy.}

   Abstract={Myocardial blood flow (MBF) abnormalities are present in early stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and have been attributed to coronary microvascular abnormalities. The favorable effects of verapamil on coronary microcirculation might indicate its use in early stage DCM. We assessed the safety of long-term combination therapy of verapamil and enalapril and its effects on both left ventricular function and myocardial perfusion compared with enalapril alone in 18 patients with DCM (15 men, 3 women; mean age, 50+/-9 years) without overt heart failure (NYHA class I-II). At baseline and after 6 months of randomized treatment with either enalapril (10-20 mg) (nine patients, group 1) or enalapril (10-20 mg) and verapamil (120-240 mg) (nine patients, group 2), left ventricular function was assessed at rest, during handgrip, and during bicycle exercise by equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Mean MBF was measured at rest and after dipyridamole by positron emission tomography (PET) and 13N-ammonia as a flow tracer. At baseline, the two groups had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, which was further impaired during isometric exercise, but increased at peak bicycle exercise. MBF was similarly reduced in the two groups at rest and during dipyridamole. During treatment, no adverse events occurred in either group. After 6 months there was no significant difference in the main study variables either between the two groups or within each group before and after treatment. Long-term combination therapy with verapamil and enalapril is safe in patients with DCM without overt heart failure. Despite no favorable effect on myocardial perfusion, combined treatment prevented deterioration of left ventricular function, similarly to enalapril alone.}

   Abstract={To conduct a systematic review of evidence relating to management of mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy, including associated risks, benefits, and harms of treatment with antihypertensive agents, nonpharmacologic measures, and aspirin and benefits of various monitoring strategies.\\ Using four broad search strategies, we searched English and non-English-language citations in 16 electronic databases from their inception to February 1999 and consulted relevant textbooks, references, and experts.\\ Reviewers screened 6228 abstracts and found 215 articles that met multiple prespecified patient selection, study population, and design criteria.\\ Forty-six studies consistently showed that chronic hypertension triples the risk for perinatal mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0, 3.7) and doubles the risk for placental abruption (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1, 3.9). Thirteen small, randomized controlled trials had inadequate power to rule in or rule out moderate-to-large (20%-50%) benefits of antihypertensive treatment. Possible adverse effects were fetal renal failure when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used in the second or third trimester and growth restriction when atenolol is used early in pregnancy. Trials showed that aspirin neither reduces nor increases perinatal and maternal morbidity, but they did not rule out possible small-to moderate beneficial or adverse effects. No studies provide guidance on benefits or consequences of various nonpharmacologic therapies or monitoring strategies.\\ Mild chronic hypertension is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks. Beneficial treatment and monitoring regimens are not clear, but some treatments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are best avoided.}

   Abstract={Amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agent, was administered to 55 children (age: 11.5 +/- 5.4 years) with hypertension, 49 of whom (89%) had secondary hypertension. Efficacy was assessed by comparing pretreatment blood pressure (BP) to follow-up BP obtained in our outpatient Pediatric Nephrology clinic. Thirty-two (58%) patients achieved BP control with amlodipine alone, and 31 (55%) patients received amlodipine twice daily. Eleven patients received amlodipine as a suspension. Mean amlodipine dose was 0.16 +/- 0.12 mg/kg/day; there was an inverse relationship between patient age and amlodipine dose. Follow-up BP were significantly lower than pretreatment BP: systolic BP fell from 129 +/- 12 to 122 +/- 12 mm Hg (P = .004), and diastolic BP fell from 78 +/- 13 to 70 +/- 19 mm Hg (P = .003). A small, clinically insignificant increase in heart rate (from 91 +/- 19 beats/min to 99 +/- 26 beats/min; P = .02) occurred during amlodipine treatment. Adverse effects reported included dizziness (three patients), fatigue (two patients), flushing (two patients), and leg edema (one patient). All improved with dose reduction. We conclude that amlodipine provides effective BP control without significant adverse effects in children with hypertension, and can be used as monotherapy in most children. Young children appear to require significantly higher doses per kilogram of body weight than older children. Twice-daily dosing may be required in many children to achieve BP control. Detailed pharmacokinetic studies are needed to confirm these observations.}

Group B (n = 48) underwent a wait-and-watch approach. Both groups of patients were allowed to use diclofenac on demand. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student's t test, the chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test.\\ The average stone size was 5.8 +/- 1.8 mm for group A and 5. 5 +/- 1.4 mm for group B. No statistically significant difference was found in stone size. Stone expulsion was observed in 38 (79%) of 48 patients in group A and in 17 (35%) of 48 patients in group B. The average expulsion time was 7 days (range 2 to 10) for group A and 20 days (range 10 to 28) for group B. A statistically significant difference was observed in both the expulsion rate and the expulsion time (P <0.05). The mean amount of sodium diclofenac used was 15 mg per patient for group A and 105 mg per patient for group B (P <0.05).\\ The medical treatment proved to be effective and safe, as demonstrated by the increased stone expulsion rate, decreased expulsion time, and reduced need for analgesic therapy.}

Patients with coingestants with recognized cardiovascular or central nervous system (CNS) effects were excluded. Two hundred eighty-three patients met criteria for review. The mean age was 27 months with 52% of all patients being boys. Nifedipine (38%), verapamil (34%), and amlodipine (14%) were most commonly ingested. Seventy-five percent of ingestions reportedly involved < or =1 pill. Symptoms occurred in 16/283 (6%): 4 had vomiting, and 12 had CNS or cardiovascular effects. The mean time to onset of symptoms for regular-release and for sustained-release (SR) CCB preparations were 1.5 hours (range 0.5 to 3 hr) and 4.5 hours (range 1 to 14 hr) respectively.\\ 74% of patients had no clinical effects, 4% minor effects, 2% moderate effects, and 20% other. No deaths or major effects were reported.\\ 88% of patients evaluated in an emergency department received gastric decontamination, usually one dose of charcoal. Calcium chloride was given in three verapamil SR cases. Five of six patients had reversal of hypotension with IV fluids and decontamination alone. Most pediatric CCB ingestions involve ingestions of small amounts of drug with no effects. Asymptomatic children in this study group who were known to have ingested <12 mg/kg of verapamil SR or <2.7 mg/kg of nifedipine SR could have been monitored at home. Of the children requiring evaluation and monitoring in a health care facility, an observation period for regular-release and SR-CCBs for 3 and 14 hours respectively would have been appropriate. There were insufficient cases with symptoms to draw conclusions for optimal therapeutic interventions.}

Ocular physiology, ocular comfort and tear volume were assessed. The trial was repeated with nicardipine in an aqueous gel vehicle. Tears were collected and assessed for protein concentration and protein profile, using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Nicardipine induced conjunctival redness and symptoms of dryness and irritation. There was no change in total tear protein concentration or volume. An increase in a 68 kDa protein was observed, this was probably due to conjunctival vessel dilation and leakage of albumin.

   Abstract={In this study, 72 newborn infants who were followed with the diagnosis of poisoning in Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, between 1975 and 1997 were evaluated retrospectively. Our purpose was to emphasize the importance of newborn poisoning among general poisoning in childhood. The age of infants ranged from 10 min to 25 days (0.82 +/- 2.81 days). Forty-seven (65.2%) infants were poisoned before or during delivery. Of the 47 infants' mothers, 46 had preeclampsia or eclampsia, and 27 received only magnesium sulfate; nine magnesium sulfate + diazepam; four magnesium sulfate + nifedipine; and the others received various drug combinations. Aside from these, one mother had Addison's disease and she used long-term dexamethasone during her pregnancy. In the newborn period, five (6.9%) infants inhaled organophosphate insecticides; eight (11.1%) ingested corrosive agents (four benzalkonium chloride; three chlorhexidine gluconate + cetrimide and an infant ammonium); four (5.5%) were poisoned by overdose of digoxin; three (4.1%) ingested overdose of phenobarbital; and two (2.7%) received acepromazine maleate. In addition, each infant ingested diphenoxilate HCL + atropine sulfate, pipenzolate bromid and tizanidine HCL. Follow-up period of the infants ranged from 24 hr to 26 days (0.82 +/- 2.81 days). The mortality rate was 17% (12/72). Death was not noted in the infants who were followed with poisoning after delivery. The causes of death were as follows: sepsis in four infants, meningitis, respiratory distress syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis in two infants each, and the effects of overdose of magnesium sulfate and diazepam in two infants, respectively. In conclusion, we would like to stress that newborn infants whose mothers received magnesium sulfate or another drug during pregnancy or delivery should be closely monitored, and calculation of drug doses should be carefully taught to hospital nurses. When baby-rooms are disinfected with organophosphate insecticides in a hospital or house, infants should be removed from the room for at least 24 hr, and use of drugs should be explained in detail to the mothers.}

   Abstract={Current concepts of esophageal motility disorders are summarized. Primary data sources were located via MEDLINE or cross-citation. No attempt was made to be comprehensive or inclusive of the literature because fewer than 10% of citations are discussed. Instead, emphasis was placed on new developments in diagnosis, therapeutics and practice patterns. Controlled therapeutic trials and pathophysiological observations are emphasized. Achalasia is a rare disease of failed lower sphincter relaxation and aperistalsis. Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), an equally rare disease, is defined by nonpropagated esophageal contractions. Nonspecific motility disorders, including nutcracker esophagus and hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter, are identified only by manometry and are 10 times as prevalent. Neuromuscular pathology is evident only with achalasia (myenteric plexus neuron destruction). Pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy with achalasia, more limited efficacy with DES and no efficacy with the nonspecific motility disorders. More efficacious therapies for the nonspecific disorders are directed at associated reflux disease or psychiatric disorders. Pneumatic dilation is effective therapy for achalasia in 72% of instances but frequently requires repeat dilation and is complicated by a 3% perforation rate. Surgical myotomy is effective in 88% of patients with achalasia; morbidity from thoracotomy has been the major limitation but has been sharply reduced with a laparoscopic approach. In conclusion, although it has been suggested that esophageal motility disorders are distinct clinical entities, critical review of the literature supports this only in the case of achalasia, a disease of well defined pathophysiology, functional disturbance and therapies. This clarity diminishes progressively for DES and nonspecific esophageal motility disorders.}

   Abstract={To describe the demographics, presentation, and outcome in patients with erythromelalgia--a rare and poorly understood clinical syndrome defined by the triad of red, hot, painful extremities.\\ Retrospective medical record review with follow-up by survey questionnaire.\\ Large tertiary care medical center.\\ Patients with erythromelalgia examined at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, between 1970 and 1994.\\ The medical records of 168 patients were analyzed. Follow-up data, which consisted of answers to 2 survey questionnaires or the most recent information in the medical record from patients still alive and death certificates or reports of death for those deceased patients, were obtained for all but 13 patients.\\ Survival, morbidity, and quality of life.\\ All patients were white; 122 (72.6%) were female, and 46 (27.4%) were male. At presentation, the patients' mean age was 55.8 years (age range, 5-91 years). Symptoms had been present since childhood in 7 patients (4.2%). Six patients (3.6%) had a first-degree relative with erythromelalgia. Symptoms were intermittent in 163 patients (97.0%) and constant in 5 (3.0%). Symptoms predominantly involved feet (148 patients [88.1%]) and hands (43 patients [25.6%]). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a significant decrease in survival compared with that expected in persons of similar age and of the same sex (P<.001). After a mean follow-up of 8.7 years (range, 1.3-20 years), 30 patients (31.9%) reported worsening of, 25 (26.6%) no change in, 29 (30.9%) improvement in, and 10 (10.6%) complete resolution of the symptoms. On a standard health status questionnaire, scores for all but one of the health domains were significantly diminished in comparison with those in the US general population.\\ Erythromelalgia is a syndrome with significantly increased mortality and morbidity compared with the US general population.}

Then, the dosage was reduced by 1/3, and the final dosage was determined to maintain MAP at 20-30% below the initial value, by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate by 0.5 mg/h.\\ Maternal MAP and heart rate (HR) were assessed every 5 min for 1 h. Foetal HR (FHR) was recorded throughout the study period and assessed for Fischer score. Gestational age, Apgar scores, birth weight, capillary filling time and the duration of stay in the paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) were used to evaluate the short-term perinatal outcome. A 15-30% decrease in MAP occurred within 15-20 min in all patients. An increase in HR was noted, and two patients had severe tachycardia. Maternal side effects included flushing, headache, nausea and dizziness. FHR showed a transient decrease in acceleration episodes and occurrence of decelerations. No nicardipine-related foetal distress occurred. Four infants born during the study period did well at birth and had a good outcome.\\ Acute nicardipine therapy can induce severe maternal tachycardia. No severe foetal or neonatal adverse effects occurred. This dose scheme requires comparison with alternative therapeutic options.}

   Abstract={Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (LTI) often provoke an undesirable increase in blood pressure (BP) and/or heart rate (HR). We tested the premise that nicardipine (NIC) and esmolol (ESM) in combination (COMB) would oppose both. Adult surgical patients received pretreatment (randomized) with IV bolus NIC 30 microg/kg (n = 31), ESM 1.0 mg/kg (n = 34), or COMB (one-half dose each, n = 32). Peak BP and HR after LTI were compared with controls (CONT; n = 35) with no pretreatment. Anesthetic induction was standardized: IV thiopental (5-7 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-2 microg/kg), and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). Systolic (S), diastolic (D), and mean (M) BP and HR awake before pretreatment (baseline) were similar in all test groups. No patient was treated for hypotension, bradycardia, or tachycardia after pretreatment or anesthetic induction. Peak HR after LTI was increased versus baseline in CONT and all test groups, but did not differ from CONT among the test groups. Peak SBP and DBP increased versus baseline in CONT, and with ESM and NIC, but not COMB. Peak SBP, DBP, and MBP were increased with ESM versus COMB, and peak DBP with ESM versus NIC. Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in BP after LTI is best blunted by the combination of nicardipine and ESM, compared with either drug alone. No single drug or combination in the doses tested opposed increased HR.\\ Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in blood pressure after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation is best blunted by the combination of nicardipine and esmolol, compared with either drug alone. No single drug or combination in the doses tested opposed increased heart rate.}

   Abstract={Hypertension (HTN) is a significant problem in pediatric renal transplant (TP) recipients, predisposing the individuals to the development of cardiovascular disease and graft dysfunction. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are considered excellent agents to treat post-TP HTN. We compared the efficacy and adverse effects of the two most commonly prescribed CCBs in our pediatric renal TP population: nifedipine (Procardia, or P) and amlodipine (Norvasc, or N). All patients (n = 24) had been started on a CCB for systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > 95%. There were no other changes in adjunctive antihypertensive medications or doses during the cross-over period. Post-TP, pretreatment (pretx) SBP was 137.6 +/- 10.9 mmHg. The post-treatment SBP were (in mmHg): 128.5 +/- 11.9 (all patients, n = 24) (p = 0.009 vs. pretx); 126.4 +/- 10.0 (P alone, n = 15) (p = 0.007 vs. pretx); 132.8 +/- 14.4 (P + other antihypertensive(s), n = 9) (p = 0.331, NS vs. pretx). The post-TP, pretreatment DBP was 88.2 +/- 11.1 mmHg. The post-treatment DBP were (in mmHg): 78.5 +/- 6.9 (all patients, n = 24) (p = 0.03 vs. pretx); 77.2 +/- 7.4 (P alone, n = 15) (p = 0.008 vs. pretx); 80.7 +/- 6.1 (P + other antihypertensive(s), n = 9) (p = 0.063, NS vs. pretx). P and N were equally effective in reducing SBP (p = 0.843, NS) and DBP (p = 0.612, NS). Cyclosporin A (CyA) dose (p = 0.81) and trough levels (p = 0.19) were similar in P- and N-treated patients. Calculated GFR was virtually identical in P- and N-treated patients (p = 0.89). Patients (or parents of) reported a higher incidence of various side-effects while receiving P, including headache, flushing, dizziness and leg cramps. Furthermore, 22/24 (91.7%) reported some degree of gingival hyperplasia during treatment with P, and all these patients reported a stabilization or reduction of hypertrophy after the switch from P to N. We conclude that CCBs (N) are efficacious drugs for the purpose of BP control and renal protection in pediatric renal TP recipients.}

   Abstract={Since large randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of nifedipine and ritodrine in the suppression of preterm labor are lacking, we performed a meta-analysis on the subject.\\ We searched the databases Medline and EMBASE using the keywords 'nifedipine', 'ritodrine' and 'randomized' or 'randomised'. The studies were scored for blinding, method of randomization and type of analysis ('intention-to-treat' versus 'par protocol'). Subsequently, two by two tables were constructed using 'delay of labor by 48 hours or more', 'delay of labor beyond 36 weeks gestation', perinatal mortality, respiratory distress syndrome and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit as end points. Homogeneity between the studies was tested with a Breslow-Day test. Pooled odds ratios were calculated in case homogeneity could not be rejected.\\ We could detect ten studies that were published between 1986 and 1998, incorporating data of 681 patients. Nifedipine reduced the risk of delivery within 48 hours compared to ritodrine, but this difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 1.1). Nifedipine also reduced the risk of delivery before 36 weeks compared to ritodrine, and this difference was statistically significant (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.90). We are not aware of studies reporting on long-term outcome.\\ Since studies reporting on long-term outcome are lacking, the choice between nifedipine and ritodrine can only be based on obstetrical and short-term neonatal outcomes. From that perspective, nifedipine should be the drug of first choice for the suppression of preterm labor.}

   Abstract={Changes in heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure were measured after extubation in 60 ASA Grade I and II patients to assess the effects of diltiazem (0.2 mg kg-1), verapamil (0.05 mg kg-1) and metoprolol (0.02 mg kg-1) given as a bolus 2 min before tracheal extubation. All the haemodynamic variables measured increased significantly after extubation in the control and diltiazem groups when compared with the base-line recordings (P < 0.05). Metoprolol effectively blocked the increases in heart rate after extubation and the increase in blood pressure in this group was less when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Verapamil alleviated the increase in both heart rate and blood pressure. However, profound hypotension and bradycardia requiring therapy, occurred in the verapamil group. For this reason, careful observation is necessary when using verapamil and the routine use of this drug in patients with coronary artery disease requires further studies.}

   Abstract={We designed a study to determine the efficacy and safety of amlodipine given once daily in the pediatric population. Twenty-one patients (mean age 13.1 years) with either essential (n=160) or renal (n=5) hypertension, and newly diagnosed (n=15) or poorly controlled or intolerant on existing antihypertensive therapy (n=6), were included. Patients received amlodipine once daily at a starting mean dose of 0.07+/-0.04 mg/kg per day. The total daily dose of amlodipine was increased 25%-50% every 5-7 days if the mean home blood pressure measurements (HBPM) were above the 95th percentile for age and gender. A baseline followed by a repeat 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitor study (ABPM) was performed in 20 patients when the mean HBPM was below the 95th percentile goal. The mean titrated dose required to control BP was 0.29+/-0.11 mg/kg per day for those < 13 years, 0.16+/-0.11 mg/kg per day for those > or = 13 years, 0.23+/-0.14 mg/kg per day for essential, hypertension and 0.24+/-0.13 mg/kg per day for renal hypertension. The ABPM demonstrated that amlodipine provided effective BP control as primary therapy in 14 essential patients. Adverse effects included fatigue (n=6), headache (n=5), facial flushing (n=4), dizziness (n=3), edema (n=3), abdominal pain (n=3), chest pain (n=2), nausea (n=1), and vomiting (n=1). Quality of life appeared to improve during therapy. Amlodipine was an effective once daily antihypertensive agent with an acceptable safety profile. Higher doses of amlodipine were required for younger patients, and monotherapy was effective in patients with essential hypertension.}

   Abstract={Prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet the incidence of preterm birth has not declined despite the use of multiple pharmacological agents to treat preterm labour. After reviewing the literature we conclude the following. beta-Agonists have been shown to prolong gestation for 24 to 48 hours; however, these agents have not been shown to decrease neonatal morbidity or mortality. Adverse effects are inevitable and can be life-threatening. There are no proven benefits to mother or fetus with long term therapy. More data are needed regarding the tolerability and efficacy of calcium antagonists before routine clinical use can be recommended. Oxytocin antagonists should be considered investigational drugs and further studies are needed to evaluate their effectiveness in the treatment of preterm labour. Furthermore, the tolerability of oxytocin antagonists in both mother and fetus has not been adequately established. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, has been shown to delay delivery in a limited number of randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials. Sulindac appears promising but has never been evaluated in a well controlled trial. Neonatal adverse effects appear to be minimal with prostaglandin inhibitors as long as the duration of treatment is short (<48 to 72 hours) and the gestational age is <32 weeks. Magnesium sulfate appears to inhibit myometrial contractility but is ineffective at prolonging gestation or preventing preterm birth. Furthermore, magnesium has not been shown to decrease neonatal morbidity or mortality; in fact, some investigators have shown an increase in infant mortality with this agent. There are no data to support adjunctive antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of preterm labour. Oral maintenance therapy with any of these tocolytic agents has not been shown to decrease the rate of preterm birth or recurrent preterm labour.}

Strategies for reducing the incidence of preterm labor and delivery have focused on educating both physicians and patients about the risks for preterm labor and methods of detecting preterm cervical dilatation. Methods used to predict preterm labor include weekly cervical assessment, transvaginal ultrasonography, detection of fetal fibronectin and home uterine activity monitoring. As yet, it is unclear if any of these strategies should be routinely employed. At present, management of preterm labor may include the use of tocolytic agents, corticosteroids and antibiotics.}

Fourteen inadequately responsive patients (3 unipolar [UP], 11 bipolar [BP]) were treated with the blind addition of carbamazepine. Carbamazepine augmentation of nimodipine converted four (29%) of the partial responders to more robust responders. Patients who showed an excellent response to the nimodipine-carbamazepine combination included individual patients with patterns of rapid cycling, ultradian cycling, UP recurrent brief depression, and one with BP type II depression. When verapamil was blindly substituted for nimodipine, two BP patients failed to maintain improvement but responded again to nimodipine and remained well with a blind transition to another dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB), isradipine. Mechanistic implications of the response to the dihydropyridine L-type CCB nimodipine alone and in combination with carbamazepine are discussed.}

   Abstract={The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of maintenance tocolysis with oral diltiazem to oral nifedipine in achieving 37 weeks gestation. After successful intravenous tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, 69 women with preterm labor at <35 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to nifedipine (20 mg orally every 4-6 hr), or diltiazem (30-60 mg orally every 4-6 hr). The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving 37 weeks gestation. Maternal cardiovascular alterations and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Sixty-nine patients were available for final analysis. Less patients on diltiazem as compared to nifedipine achieved 37 weeks (15.1% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.019). Gestational age at delivery was also less for patients receiving diltiazem (35.5 +/- 3.5 weeks vs. 33.4 +/- 3.9 weeks, P = 0.022). There were fewer days gained in utero from randomization to delivery with diltiazem as compared to nifedipine; however, this difference was not statistically significant (22.4 +/- 16.3 days vs. 31.2 +/- 24.4 days, P = 0.084). Maternal blood pressure and pulse during tocolysis did not differ significantly between groups. Despite the theoretical advantages of diltiazem tocolysis, maintenance tocolysis with diltiazem offered no benefit over nifedipine in achieving 37 weeks gestation. The cardiovascular alterations with either drug in normotensive, pregnant patients appear minimal.}

   Abstract={This study was defined as a pilot investigation of the usefulness and safety of intravenous diltiazem as adjunctive therapy to tissue plasminogen activator in acute myocardial infarction, followed by oral therapy for 4 weeks.\\ Experimental studies have documented that calcium antagonists protect the myocardial cell against the damage caused by coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion, yet no benefits have been conclusively demonstrated in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in humans.\\ In this pilot study, 59 patients with an AMI treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were randomized, double blinded, to intravenous diltiazem or placebo for 48 h, followed by oral therapy for 4 weeks. The primary objective was to detect an effect on indices of regional left ventricular function and perfusion. Patients were also closely monitored for clinical events, coronary artery patency and indices of infarct size and of left ventricular function.\\ Creatine kinase elevation, Q wave score, global and regional left ventricular function and coronary artery patency at 48 h were not significantly different between the diltiazem and placebo groups. A greater improvement observed in regional perfusion and function with diltiazem was likely explained by initial larger defects. Diltiazem, compared to placebo, reduced the rate of death, reinfarction or recurrent ischemia at 35 days from 41% to 13% (p=0.027) and prevented the need for an urgent intervention. The rate of death or myocardial infarction was reduced by 65% (p=0.15). These benefits could not be explained by differences in baseline characteristics such as age, site and extent of infarction, time of inclusion or concomitant therapy. Heart rate and blood pressure were reduced throughout the study with active diltiazem treatment. Side effects of diltiazem were bradycardia and hypotension that required transient or permanent discontinuation of the study drug in 27% of patients, vs. 17% of patients with placebo.\\ A protective effect for clinical events related to early postinfarction ischemia and reinfarction was suggested in this study, with diltiazem administered intravenously with t-PA followed by oral therapy for 1 month, with no effect on coronary artery patency and left ventricular function and perfusion.}

   Abstract={The calcium channel blocker nifedipine is widely used in children with systemic hypertension: however, because of the short duration of action, three to four daily doses of the standard preparation are required. Amlodipine once-daily, a calcium channel blocker structurally related to nifedipine with an excellent bioavailability and a long elimination half-time, has been shown to reduce blood pressure in adults. No information is available on the use of amlodipine in childhood. The effects of amlodipine once-daily (5 to 10 mg) were therefore assessed in 28 paediatric patients with hypertension. Amlodipine was withdrawn in five patients who experienced oedema and flushing. In the remaining 23 patients blood pressure was significantly reduced 3 weeks after amlodipine (on average by 7/5 mm Hg) and further decreased at 12 weeks (by 21/12 mm Hg). Heart rate and body weight were unchanged. In eight patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporine, the blood level of this agent was stable throughout the study, thus not requiring any dose adjustment.\\ The study illustrates the antihypertensive properties of amlodipine once-daily in paediatric hypertension. Amlodipine appears particularly indicated in patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporine.}

   Abstract={In a subset of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), high doses of oral calcium-channel blockers (CCB) produce a sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement. However, significant side-effects have been reported during acute testing with CCB. Therefore, to identify accurately patients who may benefit from long-term CCB therapy, there is a need for a safe, potent and short-acting vasodilator. The aim of this study was to compare the acute response to inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and oral high doses of CCB in 33 consecutive patients with PPH. A significant acute vasodilator response was defined by a fall in both mean pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance by >20%. Ten patients responded acutely to NO, nine of whom responded acutely to CCB, without any complications. The 23 other patients failed to respond to NO and CCB. In these nonresponders, nine serious adverse events were observed with CCB (38%). There was no clinical or baseline haemodynamic feature predicting acute vasodilator response. Long-term oral treatment with CCB was restricted to the nine acute responders and a sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement was observed in only six patients. In primary pulmonary hypertension, the acute response rate to high doses of calcium-channel blockers is low (27%). Serious adverse reactions to high doses of calcium-channel blockers during acute testing are frequently observed in nonresponders. It is concluded that nitric oxide may be used as a screening agent for safely identifying patients with primary pulmonary hypertension who respond acutely to calcium-channel blockers and may benefit from long-term treatment with these agents.}

   Abstract={The purpose of this study was to compare probing depth resolution achieved by gingivectomy and periodontal flap techniques in the treatment of cyclosporine A- and nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement. Ten kidney transplant patients who were receiving cyclosporine A and nifedipine for at least 6 months participated in the study. Five patients were randomly assigned to the gingivectomy group and 5 patients to the periodontal flap group. Only anterior segments of the oral cavity (canine to canine) were surgically treated. Clinical measurements, including probing depths, plaque index, and gingival sulcus index, were taken at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Results showed that probing depths, while similar for both groups in the first 6 weeks of the study, were significantly shallower for the periodontal flap group when compared to the gingivectomy group at 6 months (2.48 +/- 0.34 mm versus 4.87 +/- 0.79 mm, respectively) and 1 year (322 +/- 0.65 mm versus 6.40 +/- 1.02 mm, respectively). Within its limitations, this study suggests that the pocket reduction achieved by the periodontal flap may be sustained for longer periods of time than by the gingivectomy technique in the treatment of cyclosporine A- and nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement.}

Doppler ultrasound studies were performed on the fetal umbilical artery as control.\\ No significant differences were found in the delay of delivery, but significantly fewer maternal side-effects were found in the nifedipine group. Doppler ultrasound results were similar in both groups.\\ Nifedipine is a valid and well-tolerated alternative among the tocolytic drugs, and apparently does not significantly alter fetal vascular blood flow.}

   Abstract={In this double-blind study, we administered lumbar epidural bupivacaine or bupivacaine plus verapamil to investigate the possible role of the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, in postoperative pain. One hundred patients (ASA physical class I or II) scheduled for lower abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group 1 received 10 mL of 0.5% epidural bupivacaine injected 15 min before incision, followed by 10 mL of epidural normal saline 30 min after incision. Group 2 received 10 mL of epidural normal saline injected before incision, followed by 10 mL of 0.5% epidural bupivacaine 30 min after incision. Group 3 received 10 mL of 0.5% epidural bupivacaine plus 5 mg of verapamil injected before incision, followed by 10 mL of epidural normal saline 30 min after incision. Group 4 received the same drugs as Group 3, in the reverse order. Pain and mood numeric rating scores, sedation scores, Prince Henry scores, patient-controlled cumulative postoperative analgesic consumption, and the incidence of side effects were assessed 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the operation in each group. Cumulative postoperative analgesic consumption in Groups 3 and 4 was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in Groups 1 and 2 24 and 48 h after surgery. There were no differences in the pain, mood, and sedation scores and the incidence of side effects among the four groups. We conclude that epidural verapamil decreases postoperative pain, possibly by interfering with normal sensory processing and by preventing the establishment of central sensitization.\\ Calcium plays an important role in pain physiology at the spinal cord level. We examined the effect of bupivacaine plus verapamil (calcium channel blocker) and of bupivacaine alone. We demonstrated that the combination, administered epidurally, resulted in less postoperative analgesic consumption than bupivacaine alone.}

   Abstract={The role of calcium antagonists in patients with ischemic heart failure is currently unclear. We examined the effects of amlodipine on exercise capacity and central and regional hemodynamics in 32 patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure in a single-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. All were taking at least 40 mg of furosemide daily with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Ischemic heart disease was the most common cause of heart failure, but no patient had symptom-limiting angina. Mean treadmill exercise capacity in patients taking amlodipine increased by 96 seconds (95% confidence interval -23 to 215) and 50 seconds (-34 to 135) in the placebo group; mean difference in change between treatments was 70 seconds (-90 to 233), p = 0.38. Active treatment with amlodipine did not affect self-paced corridor walking times. Similarly, there were no significant effects on cardiac output, oxygen uptake, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure at rest or during exercise. Calf and renal blood flow were also unchanged by treatment. The lack of significant effect demonstrated by these data suggests a limited role for amlodipine in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, although it may prove beneficial in those with nonischemic disease. More data are required before amlodipine can be recommended for all patients with chronic heart failure.}

The principal outcome assessed was delay of delivery.\\ Ritodrine was discontinued in 12 patients because of severe maternal side effects, and their results were excluded from further analysis. More women in the ritodrine group delivered within 24 hours (22 versus 11, P = .006), within 48 hours (29 versus 21, P = .03), within 1 week (45 versus 36, P = .009), and within 2 weeks (52 versus 43, P = .005) compared with those receiving nifedipine. There were significantly fewer maternal side effects in the nifedipine group. Apgar scores and umbilical artery and vein pHs were similar in both groups. The number of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the nifedipine group was significantly lower than in the ritodrine group (68.4 versus 82.1%, P = .04).\\ Nifedipine in comparison with ritodrine in the management of preterm labor is significantly associated with a longer postponement of deliver, fewer maternal side effects, and fewer admissions to the NICU.}

   Abstract={Calcium channel antagonists are widely prescribed in obstetrics and gynecology for blood pressure control and tocolysis. Concerns have recently arisen regarding the safety of these agents. Several studies found that short-acting forms of calcium channel blockers were associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, malignancy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. A recent meta-analysis found a significant increase in the risk of mortality in patients treated with a short-acting form of nifedipine. Another subgroup analysis of an observational study of older hypertensive patients found a significantly increased risk of cancer and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients prescribed calcium channel blockers. Both in vitro and small human in vitro series have reported a potential for cardiac toxicity in pregnant women treated concomitantly with calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate. Until additional data are available, we suggest that when calcium channel blockers are used in obstetrics and gynecology, the long-acting variety be prescribed. Concurrent use of calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate should be undertaken cautiously because of the potential for synergistic depression of cardiac function.}

   Abstract={It is well documented that quinine induces reversible hearing loss and tinnitus. The purpose in this study was to induce a quinine hearing loss and to investigate if verapamil, a Ca2+ channel antagonist of L-type might affect the response. Pigmented guinea pigs (n = 24) were anaesthetized by atropine. Hypnorm and midazolam but permitting spontaneous respiration. An electrode of platinum was placed on the round window and short (10 msec) tone pulses at 8 kHz were presented to the external ear. A typical deflection of the N1-wave was determined as the hearing threshold. Quinine hydrochloride 40 mg/kg and verapamil 1 mg/kg were given intravenously. Quinine induced a significant and reversible hearing loss (mean 16 dB). This hearing loss was not at all affected by verapamil given before or after quinine. Verapamil often caused acute cardiac arrest and particularly the combination verapamil followed by quinine-induced death to the animal. We conclude that verapamil and quinine had no in vivo interaction with regard to the hearing ability.}

   Abstract={Cyclosporine A (CsA) and verapamil are two agents used in renal transplantation, both of which are suspected of inducing gingival overgrowth. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of verapamil on the severity and prevalence of CsA-induced gingival overgrowth. Fifty-one (51) renal transplant recipients (total group) of whom 22 were using only CsA (Group A) and 29 of whom were prescribed CsA + verapamil (Group B) were evaluated for various periodontal and pharmacological parameters. No statistically significant differences were found in age, sex, plaque index, gingival index, calculus index, probing depth, CsA oral dose, CsA whole blood level, duration of CsA therapy, azathioprine dose, and prednisolone dose. Although the prevalence of the gingival overgrowth was more pronounced in CsA + verapamil group compared to CsA group (51.72% vs. 40.91%), the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the severity of gingival overgrowth, although more manifest in CsA + verapamil group than CsA patients (34.24% vs. 28.91%), was not significantly different. Gingival overgrowth scores in the main group, CsA, and CsA + verapamil groups were found to be positively correlated to periodontal probing depths (r = 0.60, r = 0.70, r = 0.52, respectively) and the gingival index (r = 0.60, r = 0.70, r = 0.54, respectively). CsA oral dose, whole blood level, and duration of CsA therapy were not found to be correlated with the gingival overgrowth in either group. Likewise, the dose of verapamil and the duration of verapamil therapy were not correlated with the gingival overgrowth in Group B. This study indicates that verapamil, when prescribed as the calcium channel blocker in renal transplant patients, has no augmenting effect on the severity and the prevalence of CsA-induced gingival overgrowth.}

Impotence or ejaculatory failure was reported in 2.1% of the patients, decreased libido in 1% and gynaecomastia and related conditions in 0.4%. Impotence was the most frequent reason for stopping treatment with finasteride and was the most commonly reported adverse reaction to the drug. Of the patients included in the elderly cohort involved in this study, 819 (5.5%) died; none of these deaths was attributed to finasteride.\\ Impotence or ejaculatory failure, decreased libido and gynaecomastia in a small proportion of patients were associated with the use of finasteride.

   Abstract={Ultraviolet-A1 (UV-A1) wavelengths have been found effective in mitigating signs and symptoms of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but studies have been uncontrolled. To rigorously assess the effectiveness and safety of daily low-dose UV-A1 irradiation as a therapeutic agent in this disorder we enrolled 26 women with SLE in an 18-week two-phase study. During the initial six-week prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, the patients were divided into two groups; Group A was exposed to 60kJ/m2 of UV-A1 (340-400 nm) irradiation within a sunbed five days a week for three weeks and Group B was exposed for an equal amount of time to visible light of greater than > 430 nm (placebo). Each group was then crossed over for exposure to the other source for three weeks. During the second phase-2 weeks-patients and physicians were unblinded and patients were irradiated with progressively decreasing levels of UV-A1 only. Twenty-five patients completed the six-week placebo-controlled phase of the study and eighteen patients participated for the entire 18 weeks. In Group A the systemic lupus activity measure (SLAM) score improved significantly after three weeks of five-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05), regressing to baseline during the three weeks of placebo irradiation. Improvement recurred and progressed with six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 irradiation (P < 0.05). Group B patients responded negligibly to the three weeks of visible light, more sharply to UV-A1, and as with Group A, maximally to the six weeks of three-day-a-week UV-A1 (P < 0.01). With twice- and then once-weekly UV-A1 irradiation the SLAM scores worsened slightly. All patients decreased their drug use. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) and anti-nuclear antibodies non-significantly. Side effects were negligible. Visible light had no significant effect. In conclusion, low-dose UV-A1 irradiation effectively, comfortably, and without apparent toxicity diminished signs and symptoms of disease activity in SLE.}

   Abstract={In the last decade, several clinical trials in patients with, or recovering from, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have evaluated the role of calcium antagonists in affecting patients' prognosis. Results have been disparate, with evidence of possible harm, no effect, or some benefit, depending on the agent used. We evaluated how the evidence from these trials has influenced the pattern of prescription of calcium antagonists and assessed the important determinants of use of these agents in patients after AMI. We analyzed retrospectively the prescription of calcium antagonists at discharge in all patients recovering from AMI enrolled in 3 large randomized clinical trials (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell' Infarto-1 [GISSI-1], GISSI-2, and GISSI-3) during the last 10 years. A progressive decrease in prescriptions for calcium antagonists was evident, from 47.2% in GISSI-1 to 35.1% in GISSI-2 to 19.0% in GISSI-3 (p<0.001). The presence of post AMI angina, history of hypertension, and occurrence of reinfarction were associated with a higher usage of calcium antagonists, whereas the use of beta blockers at discharge was a major independent negative determinant. Use of calcium antagonists for secondary prevention after AMI (i.e., without specific clinical indications for their use) decreased by approximately 60% (from 26.1% to 10.3%). The data indicate that the usage of calcium antagonists in GISSI studies has been strongly affected by the results of other large multicenter trials evaluating calcium antagonists. These agents are now prescribed in patients after AMI almost exclusively in the presence of specific indications such as systemic hypertension or angina.}

   Abstract={Cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth was longitudinally studied in 45 adult renal transplant patients randomly assigned to be administered CsA orally in mixture or in capsule form. After 1 year of CsA therapy, 37% of the mixture and 43% of the capsule patients exhibited gingival overgrowth. In mixture patients gingival overgrowth was present, already after 1 month of CsA therapy and, after 12 months, mixture patients exhibited an increased number of sites with gingival overgrowth in the regions of the upper front and lower molars compared to capsule patients. In addition, the relative increase in gingival width of the interdental papillae of the maxillary central incisors and the mandibular first molars, measured buccolingually on stone casts, was also higher in mixture patients than in capsule patients. In a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of nifedipine and the total CsA dose administered during the first 6 posttransplant months were the predictors associated with gingival overgrowth. The study suggests that concomitant administration of nifedipine in renal transplant patients should be avoided and a change from the mixture form of CsA to the capsule form should be considered in order to minimize the development of CsA-induced gingival overgrowth.}

   Abstract={Clinicians who treat PTL should realize that side effects rarely occur when tocolytic medications are properly used. The beneficial effects of tocolytic therapy vastly outweigh the risks associated with their use for the prolongation of gestation. Even a short extension of in utero life for a few days or weeks can significantly and positively affect neonatal survival and long-term outcome. Although the opponents of tocolytic therapy argue that no reduction in the PTB rate has occurred since their introduction, this argument does not consider that the large majority of PTBs are not eligible for tocolytic intervention. If patients with clear indications for tocolysis could be compared with those that were not treated (which most studies have not done), a substantial beneficial effect of tocolytic administration probably would be demonstrated. Based on available data, we consider MgSO4 and terbutaline to be first-line tocolytics. Magnesium is used more often because of its lower side-effect profile. Indomethacin and nifedipine should be reserved for difficult or refractory preterm labor, and should only be used for intervals of < or = 48 hours. We have attempted to present a method of decision analysis which should be followed for every patient who is admitted to the obstetric care unit for a presumptive diagnosis of premature labor. We realize that many of the issues included here are controversial, however, we hope that by developing a decision tree (see Fig. 1), a more complete management scheme will be created and lead to improved care of the patient undergoing premature labor.}

The risks to both mother and neonate can be reduced by appropriate supervision and therapy. Close monitoring of maternal and fetal welfare will help to determine the optimum time for delivery. Maternal hypertension should be controlled with agents considered to be well tolerated in pregnancy. Following the index pregnancy, all patients with early and/or severe hypertension should be investigated for an underlying cause. Provided that there is clinical resolution of acute pregnancy-related hypertension, investigations are usually postponed until at least 3 months following delivery.}

   Volume="23",

   Pages="409--415",
   Abstract={The effectiveness of the tocolytic agent and other betamimetic drugs in the treatment of preterm labor remains controversial. Effectiveness or efficancy of ritodrine has not yet convincingly been proven. A major concern are the marked side effects of beta-mimetics. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine has been used for tocolysis shortly after its introduction in clinical practice and is considered to be a probable good alternative for ritodrine. The efficacy of nifedipine versus ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labor was assessed in a retrospective study. 32 patients received intravenous ritodrine and 29 oral nifedipine. As endpoints were used: postponement of delivery, maternal side effects and perinatal outcome. The results of this retrospective study suggest that nifedipine is more successful in postponing delivery than ritodrine. Maternal side effects seemed to occur more frequently and be more serious in patients treated with ritodrine as compared to nifedipine. Perinatal outcome seemed better in the nifedipine group than in the ritodrine group. The promising data from small prospective studies and the results of this retrospective study warrant further large prospective studies on the definitive place of nifedipine in the treatment of premature labor. Until the results of such a trial are available we advocate the use of nifedipine in case of preterm labor, especially in a patient with diabetes mellitus, ruptured membranes, cardiac disease or multiple pregnancy, in order to avoid the characteristic side effects of beta-mimetics.}

   Abstract={Vasodilator therapy with nifedipine reduces left ventricular volume and mass and increases the ejection fraction in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation.\\ To assess whether vasodilator therapy reduces or delays the need for valve replacement, we randomly assigned 143 asymptomatic patients with isolated, severe aortic regurgitation and normal left ventricular systolic function to receive either nifedipine (20 mg twice daily, 69 patients) or digoxin (0.25 mg daily, 74 patients).\\ By actuarial analysis, we determined that after six years a mean (+/- SD) of 34 +/- 6 percent of the patients in the digoxin group had undergone valve replacement, as compared with only 15 +/- 3 percent of those in the nifedipine group (P < 0.001). In the digoxin group, valve replacement (in a total of 20 patients) was performed because of left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 50 percent) in 75 percent, left ventricular dysfunction plus symptoms in 10 percent, and symptoms alone in 15 percent. In the nifedipine group, all six patients who underwent valve replacement did so because of the development of left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, all the patients in both groups who underwent aortic-valve replacement had an increase of 15 percent or more in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index. After aortic-valve replacement, 12 of the 16 patients (75 percent) in the digoxin group and all six patients in the nifedipine group who had had an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction before surgery had a normal ejection fraction.\\ Long-term vasodilator therapy with nifedipine reduces or delays the need for aortic-valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and normal left ventricular systolic function.}

No patient responded to treatment. Myelosuppression may have been augmented by the nifedipine and pentoxifylline (median granulocyte nadir, 0.3 x 10(9)/L). Two patients developed febrile neutropenia. Nifedipine and pentoxifylline had to be stopped in two evaluable patients due to hypotension, and three additional inevaluable patients withdrew from the study due to nifedipine-pentoxifylline toxicity before receiving their chemotherapy. There was no indication that other types of chemotherapy toxicity were increased by the addition of nifedipine and pentoxifylline. A major problem with the strategy followed in this protocol was that patients whose tumors had failed to respond to cisplatin-based regimens were often too ill to tolerate additional cisplatin, particularly when accompanied by nifedipine-associated hypotension.}

Heart rate, lead II ECG, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular dP/dT max, and cardiac index were monitored. Nine control animals received 0.2 mL/kg/min infusion of normal saline, and nine treatment animals received similar volumes of 1 mg/kg/min 3,4-DAP until systolic blood pressure reached 100 mm Hg, an elapsed time of 30 minutes, or death.\\ Verapamil toxicity was produced in all animals following an average dose of 1.38 +/- 0.44 mg/kg verapamil, and resulted in diminished mean arterial pressure, dP/dT max, cardiac index, and heart rate to average values of 47%, 32%, 46%, and 88% of baseline values, respectively. Transient atrioventricular dissociation was noted in only 22% of cases. 3,4-DAP treatment (with an average dose of 14 +/- 5.6 mg/kg) resulted in significant increases in mean arterial pressure, dP/dT max, cardiac index, and heart rate to 136%, 298%, 149%, and 158% of baseline values, respectively. Mortality was unchanged (22% in both groups). 3,4-DAP treatment was complicated by muscle twitching, tachycardia (rate of more than 180) and hypertension (diastolic blood pressure of more than 110 mm Hg) each in 44% of cases.\\ Although 3,4-DAP reversed the hypotensive and negative inotropic effects of verapamil toxicity, it failed to improve survival and resulted in several complications including muscle twitching, tachycardia, and hypertension.}

   Abstract={From 1983 to 1990, 234 patients with one or several cerebral arterial aneurysms were surgically treated in our department. Since 1983, we have been performing surgery as early as possible. As soon as the subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography (or if unconfirmed, by lumbar puncture), we assume that each patient may have an aneurysm. Between 1987 and 1990, 111 patients were treated by vascular volume expansion (maintenance of central venous pressure above 5 cm H2O with 4% albumin or Ringer-lactate or, if necessary, with 20% albumin), which we supplemented with calcium antagonists (nimodipine in 60 patients and nicardipine in 51 patients). Two months after being discharged, each patient is examined by a neurosurgeon and, on the same day, is subjected to a neuropsychological evaluation and a computed tomographic scan of the brain. A few months after this consultation, a working-position/family-activities questionnaire is issued to the patient. All of the results studied on the basis of postoperative mortality, second-month computed tomographic scan ischemia, neuropsychological evaluation, and return to work show no significant difference between the groups with or without calcium antagonists or between the nimodipine and nicardipine subgroups.}

   Abstract={Color flow imaging was used to study the effect of spontaneous low-amplitude uterine contractions (Braxton-Hicks) on flow velocity waveforms obtained from the main uterine artery in 13 women between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation. Eight women had abnormal waveforms, as defined by the presence of an early diastolic notch, and five women had normal waveforms. In the former group, three women with chronic hypertension were started on the calcium antagonist nifedipine during this study. Contractions, which were monitored by external tocography, occurred more frequently in the group with abnormal waveforms and were temporally associated with an increase in impedance to blood flow. This effect occurred to the same degree in both normal and abnormal groups, but in the abnormal group the already impaired blood flow to the intervillous space was further diminished, resulting in absence of forward flow in diastole. Such acute reductions of flow in response to frequent, impalpable uterine contractions may cause a prolonged and silent insult to uteroplacental perfusion, which could hasten fetal compromise. This effect appeared to be abolished in patients on nifedipine, suggesting a possible therapeutic role for this drug in uteroplacental insufficiency.}

   Abstract={Elevated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity correlates with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and cardiovascular risk, but the relative contributions of angiotensin II and aldosterone remain unclear. This study compared LVH regression during treatment with the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone, enalapril, and their combination in patients with hypertension.\\ A 9-month, double-blind, randomized study was performed in 202 patients with LVH and hypertension who received eplerenone 200 mg daily, enalapril 40 mg daily, or eplerenone 200 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily. At week 8, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and/or amlodipine 10 mg was added if diastolic blood pressure was >90 mm Hg. Change in left ventricular (LV) mass as assessed by MRI was the primary end point. Change in blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones, albuminuria, and safety were also assessed. Eplerenone significantly reduced LV mass from baseline (-14.5+/-3.36 g; n=50) similarly to enalapril (-19.7+/-3.20 g; n=54; P=0.258), but eplerenone/enalapril (-27.2+/-3.39 g; n=49) was more effective than eplerenone alone (P=0.007). All treatments reduced systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from baseline (eplerenone, -23.8 and -11.9 mm Hg; enalapril, -24.7 and -13.4 mm Hg; and eplerenone/enalapril, -28.7 and -14.4 mm Hg, P=0.048, in systolic blood pressure compared with eplerenone alone). Cough was more common with enalapril than with eplerenone (P=0.033), and elevated potassium was more common with eplerenone.\\ Eplerenone was as effective as enalapril in LVH regression and blood pressure control. The combination of eplerenone and enalapril was more effective in reducing LV mass and systolic blood pressure than eplerenone alone.}

   Abstract={Glucagon is usually accepted as part of the standard treatment in the management of patients with beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdoses.\\ A systematic review was done in order to evaluate the evidence supporting glucagon use in beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdoses. Studies evaluating glucagon for those uses were identified using the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MedLine, ToxLine, and EMBASE searches, as well as reviewing medical toxicology textbooks and references of identified articles. Only controlled studies of human or animal studies were included, the latter only when it was an in vivo model of acute poisoning. The quality of the included studies was assessed.\\ The search found no study in humans but identified 30 in animals. In the five studies of animal models of beta-blocker overdose included, glucagon appeared to consistently increase the heart rate at least transiently but appeared to have no effect on mean arterial pressure even though it possibly increased cardiac output. Its effect on the survival rate in animal models of beta-blocker overdose was unclear. In the six studies of animal models of calcium channel blocker overdose included, glucagon appeared to increase heart rate and cardiac output and reverse second and third degree AV blocks, all at least transiently. There appeared to be no effect of glucagon on mean arterial pressure although it did increase in one model. Glucagon appeared to have no effect on survival rate. The included studies for both overdoses were not blinded, had limited numbers of animals, and some had inadequate glucagon regime.\\ The evidence supporting the use of glucagon in the management of patients with beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdoses is limited to animal studies.}

   Abstract={Prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. Many drugs used in palliative medicine increase the QT interval and several have had their licenses withdrawn or severely restricted. The relative importance of prolonged QT interval will increase for palliative medicine physicians when dealing with patients with longer prognoses and especially cardiac disease. Given these safety concerns, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of a prolonged QT interval in palliative care patients who were not in the terminal stage and were referred to a specialist service. Of 300 patients, 47 (16%) had prolonged QTc but only two had QT >500ms. The presence of coexistent cardiac disease or high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase appear to be the clinical features most robustly associated with a prolonged QTc. Although prolonged QTc is relatively common in patients referred to a specialist palliative care service, severely prolonged QT is rare.}

   Abstract={The efficacy of pravastatin and simvastatin was first shown several years ago in patients with coronary heart disease. Other trials have since been published. In the HPS trial, which studied patients with coronary heart disease, other cardiovascular conditions, or diabetes, simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of death, coronary events and stroke when compared with placebo. In the ALLHAT-LLT trial, in patients with treated hypertension, pravastatin did not reduce overall mortality. In the PROSPER trial, in patients aged over 70 with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, pravastatin reduced the incidence of coronary events relative to placebo, but did not reduce overall mortality. Pharmacovigilance studies suggest there is no difference between these four statins in terms of their potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. Taken together, these trials show that statin use can be extended to patients with levels of LDL-cholesterol over 2.4 mmol/l (0.9 g/l) if they have coronary heart disease (and no hypercholesterolaemia), a history of ischaemic stroke, or lower-limb arterial disease. Statins can also be prescribed for diabetic patients with no signs of cardiovascular disease but whose LDL-cholesterol exceeds 3.4 mmol/l (1.3 g/l). Clinical trial data support the use of pravastatin or simvastatin in these situations, at a dose of 20 or 40 mg daily. Plasma creatine phosphokinase assay should be done if muscle symptoms occur or if the patient has a particular risk of rhabdomyolysis.}

Consultant pharmacists reviewed pharmacy records and medical charts from long-term care facilities, identifying older patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who either took CCB concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor or experienced adverse events on high-dose CCB therapy. Eligible patients were identified and their physicians contacted regarding switching them to fixed-dose combination therapy.\\ A total of 51 patients at 17 facilities were switched to fixed-dose amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy; 94.1% were women and 5.9% were men (mean age, 85.1 years; range, 64-99 years). The mean number of comorbidities was 1.6. During the subsequent 2 months, mean blood pressure remained at levels similar to those at baseline. The number of patients reporting at least 1 drug-related adverse event decreased by 81.8% (P < 0.05), and the incidence of edema decreased by 75.0%.

   Abstract={Levosimendan is a new agent for the treatment of acute heart failure. Levosimendan acts via complementary mechanisms; it enhances contractility by sensitising cardiac myofilaments to calcium and dilates blood vessels by opening ATP-dependent potassium channels. In contrast to traditional inotropes (beta-agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors), levosimendan does not raise myocyte calcium levels and is therefore less likely to elicit arrhythmias or to impair diastolic relaxation. The clinical efficacy of levosimendan is supported by four key clinical studies, including more than 900 patients hospitalised for cardiac decompensation due to acutely worsened chronic heart failure or to heart failure following myocardial infarction. When given as short-term therapy, levosimendan enhances cardiac output, reduces systemic vascular resistance and lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At 31 days post-treatment, mortality rates were halved in decompensated chronic heart failure patients who received levosimendan, compared with those on dobutamine--an advantage sustained at 180 days. Similar survival gains were observed among acute failure patients treated with levosimendan following myocardial infarction. With its substantial haemodynamic and survival benefits, levosimendan is well suited to be part of routine management for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure.}

   Abstract={The incorporation of antitachycardia pacing (ATP) into implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) has provided a better tolerated alternative to shocks. ATP has been shown to be effective in terminating approximately 80% to 90% of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes. Although ATP is routinely used, little is known about predictors of ATP failure. Based on the evaluation of stored electrograms, we aimed to prospectively follow patients with ICDs, and to analyze parameters affecting ATP effectiveness. One hundred eighteen consecutive patients received ICDs for standard indications. Before discharge, empirical, standardized ATP therapy was programmed in all patients within VT zones. A total of 1,218 spontaneous tachycardia episodes occurred in 51 patients during a mean follow-up of 24.5 +/- 12 months. Among these, 888 VTs were diagnosed. One hundred four fast VTs were detected in the ventricular fibrillation zone and treated with primary shock delivery. ATP was attempted 881 times in the remaining 784 VT episodes. ATP terminated 640 VTs successfully, ATP failed in 55 VTs finally reverted by shocks, and 89 VTs converted to a slower VT outside the VT zone. Fifty-one of these slower VTs reverted spontaneously, and 38 were redetected and treated. Finally, in primary intention-to-treat basis, ATP was successful in 691 VTs (88%) and unsuccessful in 93 VTs (12%). There was no influence of VT cycle length on ATP success rate. Furthermore, ATP efficacy was similar between patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35% or >35%, between daytime and nighttime, as well as between patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. A faster heart rate immediately preceding the onset of VT (103 +/- 19 vs 78 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively, hazard ratio 4.08, 95% confidence interval 2.11 to 7.89, p <0.001), and absence of beta-blocker therapy (82% vs 93%, respectively, hazard ratio 2.71, 95% confidence interval 1.72 to 4.29, p = 0.02) were found, by Cox proportional-hazard analysis, to be the sole independent predictors of ATP ineffectiveness in ICD recipients. Thus, the present study identified both preceding sinus tachycardia (reflecting an increased sympathetic tone) and lack of beta-blocker use as independent risk factors for reduced success of ATP therapy in terminating VT. Therefore, modification of sympathetic tone may be beneficial for patients with ICDs.}

Time from baseline to achieve blood pressure <130/85 mm Hg was shorter in the combination group (5.3+/-3.1 weeks combination vs. 6.4+/-3.8 weeks conventional; p=0.001). At 3 months, more participants in the combination group achieved treatment goal (63% combination vs. 37% conventional; p=0.002). Data analysis at 3 months comparing blood pressure control rates between the fixed-dose combination group (without HCTZ) to the conventional group (receiving HCTZ) showed an even greater disparity in blood pressure goal achievement (87% combination without HCTZ vs. 37% conventional group with HCTZ; p=0.0001). We conclude that initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination may be more efficacious than conventional monotherapy approaches for achieving blood pressure goals in the diabetic patient. A fixed-dose combination approach appears as safe as the current conventional approaches.}

   Pages="493--505",
   Abstract={The growing number of reported cases of depression and suicide associated with isotretinoin (a retinoid receptor agonist) use in patients with acne has prompted concern among dermatologists, patients, and their relatives and has triggered new warnings from regulators including depression-related, patient-informed consent forms. In establishing a cause-effect relationship, it is useful to judiciously consider whether there is an association, what is the nature of that association, if there is a plausible biological mechanism of action, the validity and reliability of measures used and the strength of study designs. Hoffmann-La Roche estimates that by April 2001 approximately 12 million patients worldwide have used isotretinoin, with 5 million patients in the US.A MEDLINE search between January 1966 and May 14 2003 of the published medical literature found 24 documented cases of isotretinoin-associated depression, with 3 suicides. One additional patient committed suicide during the fourth month of isotretinoin treatment and 3 further patients attempted suicide by taking an overdose of isotretinoin. The US FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) contains almost 23,000 reports for isotretinoin from its approval in 1982 to December 2002. As of November 30, 2002, AERS contained 3,104 reports (US and foreign) with at least one reported psychiatric event. The FDA is aware of 173 reports of suicide (both US and foreign) in association with isotretinoin. Reports of positive dechallenge and rechallenge present a strong signal pointing to an association between isotretinoin and depression. A Hoffmann-La Roche sponsored epidemiological study failed to find any evidence of an association between isotretinoin and depression or suicide. However, the design of the study was flawed and the evidence was deemed inconclusive. Further studies using strong study designs, reliable and valid measures, and adequate sample sizes may bring us closer to the answer. The evidence suggesting a relationship between isotretinoin and depression needs to be weighed against the increasing prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults and the psychological impact of acne. The literature contains credible evidence that isotretinoin treatment may reduce the psychosocial impact of acne in some patients. At the present time, there is no known pharmacological mechanism that would account for psychiatric symptomatology as a result of isotretinoin treatment; however, retinoid receptors are widely distributed in the brain and more research is needed to ascertain whether they have a role in depression. In the meantime, for the practitioner, the obvious benefit of isotretinoin in treating acne should encourage continued use. However, patients and their relatives must be informed and depressive symptoms should be actively assessed at each visit and, if necessary, referral to a psychiatrist, antidepressant therapy or discontinuation of isotretinoin should be considered.}

   Abstract={The occurrence of severe acute renal failure in 3 patients who developed diarrhoea while taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors led us to undertake a retrospective cohort survey to determine the frequency with which diarrhoea and vomiting are associated with acute renal failure in patients taking this class of drug. Serum creatinine was measured as part of the diagnostic workup of 2398 consecutive admissions to an acute medical receiving unit in a district general hospital. Outcome measures were the presence of diarrhoea and/or vomiting, and whether taking an ACE inhibitor, NSAID or diuretic at the time of admission, also previous, initial and follow up serum creatinine concentrations. Peak serum creatinine in the 3 cases was 1159, 989 and 765 micromol/l. None of the 3 required dialysis and all recovered renal function completely after receiving large volumes of intravenous fluid. In the cohort study, 89 of 2398(3.7%) admissions had serum creatinine >/=200 micromol/l. Nine were regular dialysis patients. Of the remaining patients, 30 (37.5%) were taking an ACE inhibitor. Six of 30 (20%) gave a history of diarrhoea and/or vomiting. Median creatinine concentration in this group was 135 (range 111-209) micromol/l before admission, 292 (216-724) micromol/l when first seen in hospital, and 134 (94-219) micromol/l following the withdrawal of drug therapy and fluid replacement. In conclusion, volume depletion causing acute renal failure in patients taking ACE inhibitors is not uncommon. Such patients and their general practitioners should be aware that reversible renal impairment may occur during intercurrent illnesses, particularly if characterised by diarrhoea and/or vomiting.}

In a randomized, double blind trial patients were treated for 20 weeks with fixed combinations of verapamil sustained release (SR) plus trandolapril and of atenolol plus chlorthalidone following a 2-week placebo run-in period. The main outcome measures were HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose, and fructosamine levels as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\\ HbA(1c) remained stable at 7.9% after administration of verapamil SR plus trandolapril and increased from 7.8% to 8.6% with atenolol plus chlorthalidone; the differences between treatment groups were significant at 4, 12, and 20 weeks of treatment and at last visit (P <.0001). Mean blood pressure fell from 169/96 to 150/85 and from 168/95 to 145/83 mm Hg after administration of verapamil SR plus trandolapril and atenolol plus chlorthalidone, respectively. Both combinations were well tolerated.\\ HbA(1c) and other parameters of short- and long-term glycemic control were in a more favorable range after antihypertensive treatment with verapamil SR plus trandolapril as compared with atenolol plus chlorthalidone.}

   Abstract={Numerous medications not intended for cardiac use (including antibiotics, histamine blockers, and antipsychotic medications) incidentally block potassium channels in myocardial cells, prolong the QT interval, and may trigger malignant arrhythmias. Although the odds for a given patient for developing arrhythmias are small, the number of patients receiving such drugs is enormous. Most patients developing proarrhythmia have additional risk factors that could be easily identified from their medical history. The list of risk factors includes female gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or drug-induced arrhythmias. Patients without risk factors are at very low risk. For these patients, it is neither practical nor necessary to record an electrocardiogram before therapy is initiated and the most important preventive measure is to avoid concurrent administration of 2 or more drugs that prolong the QT interval or administration of a medication that impairs the metabolism of a QT-prolonging drug. We performed a computerized literature search using the key words "long QT," "torsade," "drug-adverse effects," and "drug-ventricular arrhythmias," searching for published reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes. The references in each of these reports also were reviewed to identify additional publications. In addition, we reviewed the published reviews and the Internet sites dealing with drug-induced arrhythmias. All the original articles quoted in these reviews and Web sites were examined critically.}

   Abstract={Since the effects of bradycardia after cardiac transplantation are not known, we tested the hypothesis that perioperative bradycardia would lead to an increase in adverse outcomes after cardiac transplantation. We conducted a retrospective case control study with inclusion criterion of a heart rate (HR) less than 80 bpm during the 1st week after transplantation. Control patients were matched for gender, age and time since transplantation. We identified 34 patients as having perioperative bradycardia out of the 174 who underwent cardiac transplantation between 1994 and 1997. The results demonstrated no significant differences in donor ischemic times (180 vs. 183, p = 0.88), operative surgeon (p = 0.62) or pretransplant cardiac disease (p = 0.81) between groups. Bradycardic patients were more likely to be on pretransplant amiodarone (RR = 20.4, p < 0.001). Perioperative bradycardia did not lead to increases in cellular rejection (p = 0.72) or vasculopathy (p = 0.79). The patients prescribed pretransplant amiodarone (n = 14) had a trend toward delayed time to first rejection episode (31.0 vs. 15.5 days, median, p = 0.07). In conclusion, perioperative bradycardia does not increase adverse outcomes after cardiac transplantation and is associated with pretransplant use of amiodarone. Amiodarone may modify the recipients' immune response by delaying the occurrence of rejection.}

Patients were also randomly assigned ASA and placebo. The average follow-up time was 3.8 years. The direct costs for drugs, visits, hospitalizations, and side-effects were calculated and related to clinical outcome.\\ Resource utilization data from all the 26 countries in the study were pooled, and Swedish unit costs were applied to the aggregated resource utilization.\\ A total of 18 790 patients, 50-80 years of age (mean 61.5 years), with a diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 115 mmHg (mean 105 mmHg).\\ Antihypertensive treatment with the long-acting calcium antagonist felodipine was given to all patients. Additional therapy and dose increments in four further steps were prescribed to reach the randomized target blood pressure. Fifty per cent of the patients were randomized to a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid.\\ Direct health care costs, major cardiovascular (CV) events (myocardial infarction and stroke) and CV death.\\ The average cost of drugs and visits increased with more intensive treatment. The increase in treatment costs was partly but not fully offset by a nonsignificant reduction in the cost of CV hospitalizations. For patients with diabetes there were no significant differences in total cost between the target groups. The cost of avoiding a major CV event was negative in the base case analysis, SEK -10 360 (CI: -78 195, 75 630), and SEK 18 450 (CI: -88 789, 192 980) in a sensitivity analysis. For patients on ASA, costs were slightly but significantly higher than for patients on placebo. The estimates of the cost of avoiding a major CV event varied between SEK 41 600 and SEK 477 400, with very wide confidence intervals.\\ The treatment cost increases as the target for hypertension treatment is lowered. In patients with diabetes, intensive treatment to a lower target is cost-effective. Because of the nonsignificant difference in events, no conclusion can be made for all patients in the study. Furthermore, no conclusive evidence was found regarding the cost-effectiveness of adding ASA to the treatment of hypertension.}

   Abstract={Cerebral hyperemia has been demonstrated during emergence from anesthesia in neurosurgical patients, but its mechanism is speculative. We performed this study to test the hypothesis that this could be attributed to sympathetic overactivity. Thirty neurosurgical patients were included in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study comparing esmolol, a short-acting beta-blocker, and a placebo. Esmolol (0.3 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) was infused from the end of anesthesia to 15 min after extubation. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded before anesthesia, during anesthesia after surgery, at extubation, and 5-60 min after extubation. Cardiac output (COe) was estimated by using an esophageal Doppler from anesthesia to 60 min after extubation. CBFV, COe, and heart rate were significantly lower in the esmolol group. Mean arterial blood pressure was comparable between the groups. There was no correlation between CBFV and COe at any time point during the study. In conclusion, esmolol blunted the CBFV increase during emergence, confirming that sympathetic overactivity contributes to cerebral hyperemia during neurosurgical recovery.\\ Esmolol blunted the postoperative increase in cerebral blood flow velocity in neurosurgical patients. The origin of sympathetic hyperactivity and its potential deleterious consequences require further study.}

   Abstract={The aortic pulse wave contour in isolated systolic hypertension often shows a prominent reflection peak, which combines with the incident wave arising from cardiac ejection so as to widen pulse pressure. We investigated the effects of an extended-release nitrate preparation and of 2 angiotensin II (AII) inhibitors (an AII receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor) on the aortic pulse wave contour and systemic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects with high augmentation index caused by exaggerated pulse wave reflection. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover studies were carried out in a total of 16 elderly patients with systolic hypertension resistant to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In 1 study, pharmacodynamic responses to single doses of placebo, isosorbide mononitrate, eprosartan, and captopril were determined; in the other, single-dose isosorbide mononitrate and placebo were compared in subjects treated with AII inhibitors at baseline. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry and pulse wave components by applanation tonometry at the radial artery. All 3 agents were shown to decrease brachial systolic blood pressure, aortic systolic blood pressure, and aortic pulse pressure. Qualitative effects on the aortic pulse wave contour differed: augmentation index was not significantly altered by either captopril or eprosartan but was decreased (P<0.0001) by approximately 50% of the placebo value with isosorbide mononitrate in both study groups. We propose that isosorbide mononitrate corrected the magnified wave reflection in systolic hypertension of these elderly patients by an effect that was distinct from that exercised by either acute or chronic AII inhibition.}

During this period, the number of agents has increased greatly, as has the number of indications for which these drugs are being tested in randomized controlled clinical trials. Beginning as efficacious and very well tolerated antihypertensives, angiotensin-receptor blockers have been shown to have benefits in patients with diabetes and heart failure that are not only attributable to the reduced blood pressure, as supported by recently concluded trials. The expanding treatment areas with these agents widen the interest in their applicability across the entire cardiovascular continuum. A number of large-scale studies set to report within the next few years will further determine the effects of angiotensin-receptor blockers in a range of cardiovascular indications beyond hypertension.}

   Abstract={Numerous case reports of hyponatraemia followed increasing use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) but this adverse effect was only rarely observed in relation to citalopram. We report a case of severe hyponatraemia associated with deep coma, seizure, atrial fibrillation and muscle damage in a 92-year-old woman after only two doses of citalopram, and review 14 cases previously published in the literature and 28 cases spontaneously reported to Australian Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC). The data presented suggest that citalopram, as well as SSRIs may cause hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The majority of symptomatic cases occurred in elderly patients (79% were older than 70 years) and in women (74%). Polymedication and concomitant use of another psychotropic drug or thiazide diuretic may precipitate and/or augment the development of hyponatraemia/SIADH. In 84% of cases, the hyponatraemia associated with citalopram was detected during the first month of treatment. High level of suspicion, close and careful monitoring of serum sodium concentration particularly in elderly patients and especially in the first month of therapy with citalopram may reduce the incidence of this serious and likely not rare adverse effect.}

The primary end point was overall mortality.\\ A total of 4060 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 69.7+/-9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.\\ Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoagulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.}

   Abstract={Myocardial ischaemia and infarction are major complications immediately after coronary artery bypass grafting. They may be due to incomplete surgical revascularization, perioperative anaesthetic management or vasospasm of arterial grafts, e.g. the internal mammary artery. Infusions of nifedipine or milrinone have been advocated to prevent spasm of the mammary artery. The study compared the incidence of myocardial ischaemia after continuous infusion of either nifedipine (0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or milrinone (0.375 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) in patients with compromised left ventricular function scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft.\\ After Institutional Review Board approval, this double-blinded randomized clinical study enrolled 30 adult patients with compromised left ventricular function (ejection fraction < 0.4) scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting after written informed consent had been obtained. Ischaemia was detected by Holter electrocardiographic monitoring. The incidence of myocardial cell death was monitored by serial determinations of the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and troponin-I.\\ New ST elevation > or = 0.2 mV or new ST depression < or = 0.1 mV occurred in five of 15 patients in the milrinone group (33.3%) and in 13 of 15 patients (86.6%) in the nifedipine group (P < 0.05). There were increases in CK-MB and troponin-I in both groups. Twenty-four hours postoperatively, CK-MB (P = 0.003) and troponin-I (P = 0.001) were significantly higher in the nifedipine group.\\ Perioperative continuous infusion of milrinone, compared with nifedipine, results in a significantly lower incidence of myocardial ischaemia and myocardial cell damage after elective coronary artery bypass grafting.}

Patients with severe cutaneous reactions were excluded.\\ Incidence of DRH was defined by symptoms or diagnoses at admission that were very likely, likely, or possibly caused by prescription medications, according to a standardized assessment.\\ The incidence of DRH was 9.4 admissions per 10,000 treated patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.0-9.9]. Rates were highest for antithrombotics with 26.9 admissions per 10,000 treated patients (95% CI 23.6, 30.1). Most frequent events were gastroduodenal lesions and bleeding (45%). Digitalis preparations showed a linearly increasing trend from 2/10,000 to 14/10,000 during ten quarters ( P<0.0001), which was exclusively attributable to digitoxin, the major source of digitalis in the study area (93%). The incidence of DRH increased with age (4/10,000 to 20/10,000). The mean length of stays in patients with DRH was 13+/-10.6 days. Cumulative direct costs for hospitalization were Euro 4 million in the two urban study areas. The annual direct costs for Germany were estimated to be Euro 400 million.\\ DRHs are a considerable public health and economic burden. A longitudinal design can observe changes in population-based incidence over time. This approach can be used for public-health planning or to evaluate outcomes of quality management programs designed to reduce drug-induced illness.}

   Abstract={Autonomic dysreflexia is a common and potentially dangerous response in patients with spinal cord injury at T6 or above. Acute blood pressure elevation may be precipitated by rectosigmoid distention and anal manipulation. Topical anesthetics are widely recommended to minimize the incidence and severity of autonomic dysreflexia, although no scientific evidence supports or refutes this practice. This study tested whether topical lidocaine would prevent or limit anorectal procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.\\ We enrolled patients with chronic, complete spinal cord injury scheduled for anoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy. In a double-blind fashion they were randomized to receive either 2% lidocaine jelly (n = 18) or nonmedicated lubricant (control; n = 32) just prior to the procedure. We measured blood pressure before, during, and after procedures.\\ Mean maximal systolic blood pressure increased 35 +/- 25 mmHg in the lidocaine group vs. 45 +/- 30 mmHg in the control group (NS). However, there was a significant difference between anoscopic procedures and flexible sigmoidoscopies without anoscopy (49 +/- 29 vs. 25 +/- 20 mmHg).\\ Topical lidocaine did not significantly limit or prevent autonomic dysreflexia in susceptible patients. Both anoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy caused significant blood pressure elevation. Anoscopy, which involves stretching of the anal sphincters, was a more potent stimulus for autonomic dysreflexia than flexible sigmoidoscopy, which involves gaseous distention of the rectosigmoid. Anal sphincter stretch and rectosigmoid distention, rather than a mucosal stimulus, are likely nociceptive triggers for procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.}

   Abstract={Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportions in many countries and is the most common cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD). The angiotensin II receptor-1 (AT(1)) antagonists losartan and irbesartan have recently been evaluated as renoprotective agents in large clinical trials of patients with Type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. In the Reduction of End points in Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist (RENAAL) study, losartan decreased the number of patients reaching the primary end point of a composite of measures of neuropathy. The relative risk reduction was approximately 15% with losartan and this was due to a reduction in both the doubling of creatinine concentration (25%) and of ESRD (28%) but not in death. In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), the beneficial effect of irbesartan was mainly against the doubling of the baseline creatinine concentration (37% risk reduction) but there was also a 20% reduction in the onset of ESRD. Irbesartan had no effect on mortality. Beneficial effects occurred in addition to blood pressure being controlled by agents other than the AT(1) antagonists. These clinical trials suggest that there may be a class renoprotective action with AT(1) antagonists, although the mechanism is not clear. Patients with Type 2 diabetes and nephropathy should receive either an AT(1) antagonist or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril to ensure renoprotection.}

   Abstract={It is thought that up to 50% of patients with cerebrovascular disease will have concurrent ischaemic heart disease. Dipyridamole co-formulated with aspirin has been shown to increase the relative reduction in risk of second stroke in patients with prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack beyond that obtaining with aspirin alone. We have sought to resolve the question of whether dipyridamole treatment increases the risk of cardiac adverse events in patients with co-existing ischaemic heart disease. The published literature, periodic safety update reports, the randomised controlled trials of antiplatelet agents in stroke prevention and those including dipyridamole in cardiovascular indications, have been reviewed and analysed. The early reports of serious adverse cardiac effect attributable to dipyridamole occurred in patients with severe coronary artery disease using dipyridamole as a stress test adjunct to cardiac imaging. The randomised controlled trials databases show no evidence of mortality and only isolated cases of significant cardiac morbidity attributable to dipyridamole at recommended oral doses in patients with ischaemic heart disease. We conclude that patients with cerebrovascular and mild to moderate concomitant ischaemic heart disease may be treated safely with dipyridamole for the secondary prevention of stroke.}

This adverse effect is shared by all statins, but is more common with cerivastatin, especially in combination with gemfibrozil. The risk of myopathy is increased by: the use of high doses of statins, concurrent use of fibrates, concurrent use of hepatic cytochrome P450 inhibitors, acute viral infections, major trauma, surgery, hypothyroidism and other conditions. Statin-associated myopathy should be suspected when a statin-treated patient complains of unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. Statin therapy should be stopped in cases of suspected myopathy, and serum creatine kinase levels should be checked and monitored. No specific therapies other than statin withdrawal and supportive measures for rhabdomyolysis are currently available.}

   Abstract={It is unknown whether either the angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan or the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine slows the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes independently of its capacity to lower the systemic blood pressure.\\ We randomly assigned 1715 hypertensive patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes to treatment with irbesartan (300 mg daily), amlodipine (10 mg daily), or placebo. The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less in all groups. We compared the groups with regard to the time to the primary composite end point of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, the development of end-stage renal disease, or death from any cause. We also compared them with regard to the time to a secondary, cardiovascular composite end point.\\ The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a risk of the primary composite end point that was 20 percent lower than that in the placebo group (P=0.02) and 23 percent lower than that in the amlodipine group (P=0.006). The risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was 33 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.003) and 37 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the amlodipine group (P<0.001). Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a relative risk of end-stage renal disease that was 23 percent lower than that in both other groups (P=0.07 for both comparisons). These differences were not explained by differences in the blood pressures that were achieved. The serum creatinine concentration increased 24 percent more slowly in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.008) and 21 percent more slowly than in the amlodipine group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences in the rates of death from any cause or in the cardiovascular composite end point.\\ The angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan is effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. This protection is independent of the reduction in blood pressure it causes.}

   Abstract={Drug-related illness is an everlasting universal problem and also an important cause of admissions to hospitals. Adverse reactions are still grossly underreported by medical professions. Little information is available regarding the frequency or type of ADRs managed in hospitals. Since January 1997, we have taken part in a study, supported by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Device to improve the spontaneous drug information reporting system in Germany. Three German regionalized Departments of Clinical Pharmacology--Jena, Dresden, Rostock--serve as Pharmacovigilance Centers in collaboration with the Pharmacoepidemiology Research Group of the University of Munich. Since January 1997, the regional group in Jena has been monitoring the University Clinic of Internal Medicine for admissions caused by adverse drug reactions. All emergency cases and patients on intensive care units were checked for adverse drug reactions. We present our results, including clinical and demographic data, concerning intoxications and especially those involving digitoxin in 210 patients with ADR. Forty patients with digitoxin toxicity had an average age of 81 years (81.1+/-6.3), a low body weight (59.7+/-12.7 kg) and 3 out of 4 were women. 75% of all patients with digitoxin side effects had elevated serum digitoxin levels with concentrations higher than 25 microg/ml. The relatively high frequency of digitoxin intoxications in our hospital may reflect the advanced age and low body weight of patients. Patients received digitoxin regardless of age, weight and, sometimes, clinical indication. Physicians should be aware of drugs having a high risk when used in elderly patients. The use of digitoxin assays and keeping serum levels within or near the therapeutic range will diminish the incidence of overdoses.}

   Pages="109--121",
   Abstract={Chronic stable angina is a common condition with a prognosis that is less benign than is generally appreciated. The optimal treatment strategy of this disorder is unclear, and few anti-ischaemic agents have been rigorously tested in prospectively randomised mortality studies. The evidence base for the anti-ischaemic therapy of chronic angina draws upon data 'borrowed' from studies in acute coronary syndromes, and from studies in chronic angina using surrogate endpoints such as ambulatory silent ischaemia. Such evidence leads us to believe that anti-ischaemic therapy with beta-blockers offers a mortality benefit in chronic angina. In contrast, the mortality benefit of lipid lowering therapy and antiplatelet agents is well proven. Angioplasty offers no mortality benefit in the treatment of chronic angina, although it is more effective than medical therapy alone for the relief of symptoms. In a few patients with high order proximal coronary disease, coronary bypass surgery offers a distinct mortality advantage compared with medical treatment alone. Most patients, however, do not warrant such an approach, and only require surgery for when they remain symptomatic despite adequate medical therapy. Alternative strategies such as cardiac transplantation, transmyocardial laser revascularisation and spinal cord stimulation are now accepted in a subgroup of patients for the treatment of chronic angina refractory to standard therapy.}

   Abstract={One of the arguments put forward against the primary use of beta-blockers has been concern about adverse metabolic effects, such as unfavorable effects on lipids or insulin sensitivity. Another less-appreciated potential drawback is their propensity to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled trials that lasted >/=6 months, body weight was higher in the beta-blocker than in the control group at the end of the study. The median difference in body weight was 1.2 kg (range -0.4 to 3.5 kg). A regression analysis suggested that beta-blockers were associated with an initial weight gain during the first few months. Thereafter, no further weight gain compared with controls was apparent. There was no relationship between demographic characteristics and changes in body weight. Based on these observations, the first-line use of beta-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed. Obesity management in overweight hypertensive patients may be more difficult in the face of beta-blocker treatment.}

   Abstract={Arthritis and hypertension are frequent comorbidities in the elderly hypertensive population. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in arthritic patients but a side effect is sodium retention and consequent elevation of blood pressure (BP). The effect of dihydropyridine calcium blocking drugs is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors' effects can be blunted by a high-sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension who had been controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. Indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study to patients controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. The response was assessed by ambulatory BP measurement. Indomethacin raised BP and lowered pulse rates in patients taking enalapril but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. The difference caused by indomethacin between the two groups was 10.1/4.9 mm Hg increase in BP and a 5.6 beats/min fall in pulse in people taking enalapril. Addition of indomethacin to patients taking either drug caused a rise in weight and a fall in plasma renin. It is postulated that the effect is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. In patients taking amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin ameliorates the effect of sodium retention on BP. In patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls but this is not translated into an effect because of the blockage of converting enzyme. Thus, the full effect of sodium retention on BP is expressed. In patients treated with indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to ACE inhibitors. However, the major problem is the patient who intermittently takes indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, if a person is treated by an ACE inhibitor causes BP to go out of control. In such patients amlodipine would appear to be a preferred choice to enalapril.}

End points were changes in average systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) from the two clinic visits before and after conversion. In addition, data were collected and analyzed with regard to adverse drug reactions, average dosage of the alternative calcium channel blocker, number of additional antihypertensives begun or discontinued, and number of dosage changes in antihypertensives within the two visits after conversion, and the overall cost impact of conversion. Average systolic blood pressure was reduced from 141.6 +/- 15.1 to 139.2 +/- 15.3 mm Hg after the conversion (NS). Average diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced from 74 +/- 9.5 to 72.6 +/- 10.1 mm Hg after conversion (p=0.032), as was MAP (97.0 +/-q 9.3 to 94.8 +/- 10.0 mm Hg, p=0.026). Five patients had other changes in therapy made concurrently at the time of conversion, and 19 had changes after conversion. When these patients were excluded from analysis, the reduction in systolic blood pressure after conversion was significant (141.4 +/- 14.5 to 137.7 +/- 14.3 mm Hg, p=0.022), as were reductions in diastolic blood pressure (74.4 +/- 9.4 to 71.7 +/- 9.8 mm Hg, p=0.014) and MAP (96.7 +/- 9.1 to 93.7 +/- 9.3 mm Hg, p=0.007). Of patients who had postconversion changes in therapy, 8 (42%) were converted to diltiazem ER, nifedipine CC, or doses of felodipine that were 50% of the original dose of amlodipine. The overall cost impact of the conversion was a net savings of $14,858/year for each 100 patients converted.\\ Conversion from amlodipine to other calcium channel blockers resulted in statistically significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure and MAP, and was safe as well as cost-effective. Conversion to calcium channel antagonists other than felodipine or less than equal dosages of felodipine may require dosage titration. When converting patients from amlodipine, dosages usually should be equal to those of felodipine; if converting to other calcium channel antagonists, the need for adjustments should be anticipated.}

Patients then entered a final 4-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal period of candesartan alone. A total of 216 patients were recruited. After a 2-week run-in period on placebo tablets, mean sitting blood pressure (BP) was 175/108 mm Hg. At the end of the 12-week dose-titration/maintenance period, mean sitting BP fell to 141/88 mm Hg.

In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil is an effective BP-lowering drug when used alone or in combination with amlodipine or amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. The drug was well tolerated throughout the investigation period.}

   Abstract={To review the available literature on the use of intravenous calcium salts for the prevention of hypotension associated with intravenous verapamil.\\ A MEDLINE search (1966-June 1999) identified pertinent articles; references from these articles were identified to serve as additional resources.\\ Verapamil is effective in inhibiting atrioventricular nodal conduction, thereby controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter and terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. However, hypotension may be caused by the negative inotropic and vasodilating effects of verapamil. In vitro and animal data suggest that calcium pretreatment may minimize the effects of verapamil on cardiac output and blood pressure. Case reports suggest that intravenous calcium may be useful for both prevention and reversal of the hemodynamic effects of verapamil. A number of small clinical trials have been performed, suggesting that calcium administered prior to intravenous verapamil results in a decreased incidence of hypotension. The most common adverse effect of intravenous calcium is flushing.\\ Calcium pretreatment prior to intravenous calcium-channel blocker administration should be considered in patients in whom further reductions in blood pressure may precipitate hypoperfusion or worsen underlying cardiovascular status. A dose of calcium gluconate 1 g (ionized calcium 90 mg) administered over three minutes is recommended for preventing or lessening the hypotensive effect of verapamil without affecting the antiarrhythmic effects of verapamil.}

We hypothesised that pharmacotherapy guided by plasma concentrations of the cardiac peptide aminoterminal brain natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) would produce a superior outcome to empirical trial-based therapy dictated by clinical acumen.\\ 69 patients with impaired systolic function (left-ventricular ejection fraction <40%) and symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV) were randomised to receive treatment guided by either plasma N-BNP concentration (BNP group) or standardised clinical assessment (clinical group).\\ During follow-up (minimum 6-months, median 9.5 months), there were fewer total cardiovascular events (death, hospital admission, or heart failure decompensation) in the BNP group than in the clinical group (19 vs 54, p=0.02). At 6 months, 27% of patients in the BNP group and 53% in the clinical group had experienced a first cardiovascular event (p=0.034). Changes in left-ventricular function, quality of life, renal function, and adverse events were similar in both groups.\\ N-BNP-guided treatment of heart failure reduced total cardiovascular events, and delayed time to first event compared with intensive clinically guided treatment.}

   Abstract={Numerous studies have shown a beneficial effect of combination therapy with beta-blockers and calcium antagonists in patients with anginal syndrome and/or hypertension. However, because both agents exert a negative chronotropic effect, their combined use may cause bradyarrhythmias with resultant symptoms of cerebral, coronary, and systemic hypoperfusion. We describe our clinical experience with patients who had cardiovascular adverse drug reactions (CVADRs) with combination therapy. This prospective study included 26 patients who had CVADRs among 2,574 admissions during a 2-year period. The study group included 14 men and 12 women with a median age of 73 years. Various combinations of calcium antagonists and beta-blockers were associated with the CVADRs. The most frequent pharmacologic combination was diltiazem plus propranolol. The CVADRs were the cause for hospital admission in 10 patients, an associated cause in nine patients, and developed during hospitalization in seven patients. Cardiac bradyarrhythmias were found in 22 patients. These rhythm abnormalities resolved within 24 h after discontinuation of the offending drugs. Temporary transvenous pacemaker insertion was necessary in only one patient with complete atrioventricular block. Twenty-two patients recovered, two patients died of pump failure not associated with CVADRs, and in two patients, the CVADRs contributed to the patients' death. CVADRs are not uncommon in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease and/or hypertension treated with the concomitant use of calcium antagonist and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Use of calcium antagonist plus beta-blocker may unpredictably cause serious hemodynamic events, marked suppression of sinus node activity, and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction in some patients. Enhanced therapeutic monitoring may be warranted when calcium antagonists are combined with beta-blockers.}

   Abstract={D-methamphetamine is abused for its euphoric effects and stimulatory action on cognitive function. Its abuse can, however, be associated with massive hypertension resulting in strokes, ruptured aneurysms, or myocardial infarction. We examined the utility of isradipine, a dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonist, in treating d-methamphetamine induced hypertension and evaluated its effects on cognitive function, both of which are mediated by dopaminergic mechanisms. D-methamphetamine dose-dependently increased all vital signs (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and pulse rate) parameters. Isradipine significantly reduced d-methamphetamine-induced increases in diastolic and mean arterial pressure; however, this potentially beneficial therapeutic effect was offset by a significant reflex rise in pulse rate. D-methamphetamine also improved attention, accuracy of reasoning ability, and performance on computerized cognitive function tasks. D-methamphetamine's cognitive improving effects were not altered significantly by isradipine. Isradipine increased the false responding rate but was without significant effect on any other attentional task, or on reasoning ability, or performance. Isradipine does not appear to enhance cognitive function in healthy humans.}

After drug titration, patients with a DBP of less than 90 mm Hg were followed up for 1 year. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles were determined at baseline, after initial titration, and at 1 year.\\ After 8 weeks on a regimen of hydrochlorothiazide, increases of 3.3 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L) in total cholesterol and 2.7 mg/dL in apolipoprotein B were significantly different (P< or =.05) from decreases of 9.3 mg/dL in total cholesterol and 5.4 mg/dL in ApoB levels while receiving prazosin but not from placebo. Patients achieving positive DBP control using hydrochlorothiazide (responders) showed no adverse changes in PLPPs, whereas nonresponders exhibited increases in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles did not change significantly among treatment groups after 1 year except for minor decreases in high-density lipoprotein 2 levels using hydrochlorothiazide, clonidine, and atenolol.\\ None of these 6 antihypertensive drugs has any long-term adverse effects on PLPPs and, therefore, may be safely prescribed. Previously reported short-term adverse effects from using hydrochlorothiazide are limited to nonresponders.}

   Abstract={A total of 254 elderly hypertensive patients (71 men and 183 women aged between 63 and 92 years, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-115 mm Hg inclusive) were treated with the fixed combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril following a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Treatment was started with a response dependent 3-step dose titration period. All patients were initiated at dose step 1 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 120/0.5 mg o.d.) and if not normalised (DBP <90 mm Hg) titrated at 4-weekly intervals over dose step 2 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/1 mg o.d.) to dose step 3 (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg o.d.) during the first 12 weeks. After 3 months of treatment all patients not normalised were excluded from further participation in the study. The total duration of the treatment period was 6 months. Routine safety investigations were performed prior, during and on completion of the treatment period. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was highly effective in reducing blood pressure. At individual last visit during active treatment (also taking the non-responders into account), the mean reduction in SBP/DBP was 21.9/17.1 mm Hg (95% CI 19.8-24.1/16.1-18.1 mm Hg), with most of this reduction occurring during the first 3 months of treatment. After 6 months, 81.9% of the patients enrolled showed normalisation of DBP (<90 mm Hg) and 85% were responders (normalisation and/or reduction in DBP by at least 10 mm Hg). Normalisation and responder rates appeared to be comparable when stratified by age subgroups (63-69, 70-79 and > or =80 years) and were all greater than 80%. Verapamil SR/trandolapril was very well tolerated and there was no evidence of any clinically relevant changes in routine laboratory safety variables or resting ECG. In conclusion, the fixed dose combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril is an effective and safe alternative treatment for the elderly hypertensive patient.}

The study was conducted with prescription sequence analysis of each resident's detailed pharmacy records and data on morbidity and mobility.\\ Use of drugs, which according to the summaries of product characteristics (SPC) and the literature on adverse drug effects have moderately to strongly constipating properties, was associated with a relative risk of 1.59 (95% CI 1.24-2.04) for the occurrence of constipation during exposure time. Use of drugs with mildly to moderately constipating effects was not associated with laxative use (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Stratification on the level of age, gender, type of nursing (psychogeriatric or somatic), morbidity, number of medications taken and mobility showed no confounding effects of these variables on outcome measurements. These variables all acted as effect modifiers. Effect of age and number of medications taken on the relative risk was nonlinear.\\ Although an association between drugs that exhibit moderately to strongly constipating effects and occurrence of constipation was found, the risk was not as high as seen in previous studies. The high prevalence of constipation in nursing home patients is only partly due to adverse drug effects.}

Postmarketing surveillance revealed a potential serious interaction between mibefradil and beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil, and diltiazem, especially in elderly patients. The manufacturer voluntarily withdrew mibefradil on June 8, 1998. We describe 4 cases of cardiogenic shock in patients taking mibefradil and beta-blockers who began taking dihydropyridine CCBs. One case resulted in death; the other 3 survived episodes of cardiogenic shock with intensive support of heart rate and blood pressure. Physicians who are preparing to switch patients' medications from mibefradil to other antihypertensive agents should be aware of these potentially life-threatening drug-drug interactions.}

   Pages="27--29",
   Abstract={Calcium antagonists (CaAs) are divided into three structural classes, typically represented by verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine. As a group, the principal (type I) adverse effects of these drugs relate to the pharmacological action of calcium channel blockade, namely vasodilation, and include dizziness, flushing, palpitations and peripheral oedema. The clinical safety of the new dihydropyridine CaA, barnidipine, has been assessed in more than 12 clinical trials, including 2041 patients who have been treated with one or more doses of barnidipine (dose of up to 50 mg). Adverse events with barnidipine are of mild to moderate intensity, most commonly of type I, occurring in the early phase of treatment. The incidence of serious adverse events and the rate of withdrawals are low. Hence, barnidipine is likely to be well tolerated in general clinical use.}

No clinical differences between CIP and other DIP were found. Most of the patients (66 of 74) completely recovered after cinnarizine withdrawal in 1-16 months. Eleven patients later developed Parkinson's disease; four of them had previously recovered. Five patients had tardive dyskinesia. CIP accounts for a high proportion of DIP referred to neurologists in populations in which cinnarizine is widely prescribed. The symptoms typically resolve after drug withdrawal, although complete recovery may take more than 1 year.}

   Abstract={To generate current incidence-based estimates of the direct medical costs of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the United States, a Markov model of the economic costs of CAD-related medical care was developed. Risks of initial and subsequent CAD events (sudden CAD death, fatal/nonfatal acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina, and stable angina) were estimated using new Framingham Heart Study risk equations and population risk profiles derived from national survey data. Costs were assumed to be those related to treatment of initial and subsequent CAD events ("event-related") and follow-up care ("nonevent-related"), respectively. Cost estimates were derived primarily from national public-use databases. First-year direct medical costs of treating CAD events are estimated to be $17,532 for fatal AMI, $15,540 for nonfatal AMI, $2,569 for stable angina, $12,058 for unstable angina, and $713 for sudden CAD death. Nonevent-related direct costs of CAD treatment are estimated to be $1,051 annually. The annual incidence of CAD in the United States is estimated at 616,900 cases, with first-year costs of treatment totaling $5.54 billion. Five- and 10-year cumulative costs in 1995 dollars for patients who are initially free of CAD are estimated at $9.2 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively; for all patients with CAD, these costs are estimated to be $71.5 billion and $126.6 billion, respectively. The direct medical costs of CAD create a large economic burden for the United States health-care system.}

Dahl S/Jr inbred rats were assigned to daily exercise (EX) or sedentary (SED) treatment conditions (n = 12/group) at 4 weeks of age. Rats in the EX group were housed in cages with attached running wheels. After 5 weeks of exercise, rats were running 10.3 +/- 1.7 km/day. After at least 5 wks of treatment, all rats in both groups were placed on a 4.0% NaCl diet for 2 weeks to produce sodium-induced hypertension. Rats continued to either exercise daily or remain sedentary for an additional 2 weeks while consuming the high sodium diet. Carotid and jugular catheters were then implanted for measurements in conscious, resting, unrestrained rats on two separate days. Daily wheel running exercise for 7 to 9 weeks did not alter BP or HR in Dahl S/Jr rats consuming a 4.0% NaCl diet. However, acute arterial depressor responses to ganglionic blockade were less in EX rats. Furthermore, greater alpha-adrenergic (phenylephrine-induced) pressor responses were observed in the EX group while under ganglionic blockade. The findings suggest that overall resting sympathetic neural activity or cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness to sympathetic activity is reduced in this model of hypertension by daily wheel running exercise.}

   Abstract={The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study is an ongoing prospective randomized, multicentre trial conducted in 26 countries. There are two main aims of the study. The first is to evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure (< or = 90, < or = 85 or < or = 80 mmHg) and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. The second is to determine the effect on morbidity and mortality of a low dose, 75 mg daily, of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) compared with placebo. Altogether 18,790 patients have been recruited and randomized, and two-year data are now available for all patients. This is a report on the blood pressures achieved, the tolerability, and other available data after 24 months of follow-up of all patients. Special emphasis is given to the subgroup of elderly patients (> or = 65 years, n = 5988) compared with young patients (< 65 years, n = 12 802). On average, patients in the < or = 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure target group have reached 85 mmHg, in the < or = 85 mmHg target group patients have reached 83 mmHg and in the < or = 80 mmHg target group patients have reached 81 mmHg. The percentage of those achieving target blood pressure in each target group at 24 months of follow-up is 85% in the < or = 90 mmHg target group, 75% in the < or = 85 mmHg target group and 57% in the < or = 80 mmHg target group. In the elderly subgroup (> or = 65 years of age), the percentage of patients achieving target at 24 months is higher for all target groups, namely 89% in the < or = 90 mmHg group, 80% in the 85 mmHg group and 62% in the 80 mmHg group. Antihypertensive treatment was initiated with a calcium antagonist, felodipine, at a dose of 5 mg once daily. If target blood pressure was not reached, additional antihypertensive therapy, with either an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was given. Further dose adjustments were made in accordance with a set protocol. As a fifth, and final, step, a diuretic could be added. There have been relatively few side effects in this large, multinational study of hypertensive patients. Only ankle oedema and coughing exceed a frequency of 0.5% (ankle oedema 1.3% in young and 1.7% in elderly; coughing 0.5% in young and elderly). After two years, 84% of all patients are still taking their baseline therapy, felodipine. The 24-month data presented here indicate that it should be possible to fulfil the primary aims of the HOT Study.}

   Abstract={We evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of gallopamil 150 mg/day and its effects on myocardial perfusion in a medium-term, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial. We studied 19 patients (17 males and 2 females; mean age 57 +/- 6.8 years) with stable effort angina, angiographically documented coronary artery disease and reversible perfusion defects during exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy of at least one segment of the left ventricle. After 2 weeks of a single-blind placebo run-in period, during which each patient underwent at least 2 exercise tests and a 48-hour Holter ECG recording, all patients were treated with either placebo or gallopamil 50 mg t.i.d. for 28 days. At the end of this period, patients crossed over to the alternate regimen. This phase was double blind. After treatment with placebo or gallopamil, patients underwent exercise tests, 24-hour Holter ECG recording and thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy. Weekly angina frequency and trinitroglycerin (TNT) consumption and safety were also evaluated. No patients dropped out of the study because of major side effects. The number of total ischemic and symptomatic events recorded at 24-hour ECG monitoring, weekly angina frequency and TNT consumption were significantly reduced during gallopamil treatment. After gallopamil administration, exercise duration significantly increased (run-in: 419 +/- 116 s, placebo: 420 +/- 118 s, gallopamil: 511 +/- 144 s; p < 0.05), and ST segment depression was significantly reduced (run-in: -1.3 +/- 0.3 mm, placebo: -1.3 +/- 0.3 mm, gallopamil: -0.94 +/- 0.68 mm; p < 0.01), while heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product were unchanged at rest, at submaximal and at peak exercise. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of myocardial perfusion and the myocardial uptake percentage of thallium-201 in ischemic zones were significantly improved by gallopamil treatment. These findings demonstrate that gallopamil can improve myocardial perfusion and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption.}

   Abstract={The pharmacokinetic actions, bioequivalence, and cardiovascular effects of two verapamil products were studied in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in eight elderly hypertensive patients (median age, 69.5 years; range, 60-79 years) given brand-name or generic immediate-release verapamil in 120-mg twice-daily doses for 14 days. Blood pressures, heart rates, P-R intervals; and serum concentrations of R-/S-verapamil and norverapamil were measured multiple times in patients during the last day of each therapy. Median blood pressure decreased more with generic verapamil than with the brand-name drug, with the largest difference occurring at 0.5 hours (137/74 mmHg versus 144.5/80.5 mmHg; P = 0.05 and 0.091, respectively). Pharmacokinetic parameters were not different for the two products (P < 0.01). However, the generic product, compared with the brand-name drug, had mean area under the concentration-time curve (time 0 to 12 hours) ratios (90% CI) of 1.09 (0.78-1.52), 1.16 (0.87-1.55) and 1.11 (0.81-1.52) for R-, S-, and total verapamil. Seventy concentration peaks (31 with the brand-name drug, 39 with the generic drug) appeared between 8 and 24 hours. Median percentages of increase of these peaks, compared with those of previous concentrations, were 48.3% and 36.3% for brand-name and generic drugs, respectively. Fifty of the 70 peaks (71%) were associated with a stereospecific concentration peak of norverapamil and, temporally, with meals. Our findings suggest that whereas the two verapamil products may not be bioequivalent by Food and Drug Administration criteria, the observed differences in effects were not clinically significant in this elderly population. Multiple concentration peaks after absorption were observed in all patients with both verapamil products and were perhaps related to enterohepatic recirculation.}

Of these 19,141 reports, 220 (1.1%) were concerned with drug-induced chest pain or myocardial infarction. After excluding reports in which the causal relationship was unlikely, poorly documented reports and reports on cases of overdosage, 183 reports (84%) were analysed.\\ There were 130 reports (71%) of drug-induced chest pain and 53 reports (29%) of drug-induced myocardial infarction. A total of 104 reports concerned females (57%). The most frequently reported suspected drugs were the antimigraine drug sumatriptan (33 reports, 4 concerning myocardial infarction), the calcium antagonist nifedipin (9 reports, 2 of myocardial infarction) and nicotine [9 reports (8 patches, 1 chewing gum), 5 concerning myocardial infarction]. There were 18 reports of a fatal outcome.\\ Several drugs can produce chest pain or myocardial ischaemia. It is important to recognise drugs as a potential cause, especially in patients with normal coronary arteries.}

   Abstract={To assess the impact of sumatriptan in clinical practice, we undertook a retrospective analysis of the government of Newfoundland and Labrador's prescription drug program data base for 35 consecutive patients prescribed sumatriptan. The number of doses of all drugs prescribed ranged from 121 to 18,874 on from 4 to 357 prescriptions per patient over 1 to 19 months. The mean number of doses of analgesic drugs prescribed before sumatriptan therapy was 56 per month and after initiation of sumatriptan was 46 per month. The prescribing of multiple analgesics was common; 79% received three or more different analgesics. Twenty-two (63%) patients were prescribed medications indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine concomitantly with drugs indicated for symptomatic treatment. Twenty-four (69%) patients were prescribed medication capable of inducing migraine. We conclude that sumatriptan did not have a major impact on the outcomes of these patients judged by their use of analgesics. The simplest explanation is that many of the patients were suffering from analgesic-induced headache rather than migraine. In addition, we conclude that there were deficiencies in prescribing practices including numbers, quantities, and choice of analgesics; the use of analgesics concomitantly with drugs indicated for migraine prophylaxis; and the use of drugs capable of inducing migraine. Further research is required to validate these findings.}

Physiologic rational for the chronobiology of cardiac disease exists and can provide a basis on which to examine the efficacy of agents to manage cardiac disease. The use of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices have advanced our ability to describe the interplay of chronobiologic rhythms and pharmacodynamic response to antihypertensive medications. This review summarizes the studies evaluating the use of various antihypertensive medications in the context of using 24-hour blood pressure monitoring devices. The studies are described in an attempt to increase awareness of chronobiology and potential implications of designing chronotherapeutic regimens.}

Insulin sensitivity (by the minimal model method of Bergman), additional metabolic variables, clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure profile and renal indices were assessed at the end of the placebo and active treatment phases.\\ Compared with placebo, the two therapies produced similar decreases in mean supine clinic blood pressure [10 +/- 3 versus 11 +/- 3% (means +/- SEM)], upright clinic blood pressure (10 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 4%) and ambulatory daytime blood pressure (9 +/- 2 versus 12 +/- 3%). However, although the verapamil-trandolapril combination was found to be metabolically neutral, the atenolol-chlortalidone combination aggravated insulin resistance [insulin sensitivity index, from (0.8 +/- 0.2) to (0.3 +/- 0.1) x 10(-4)/min per U per ml], increased the serum triglycerides level and decreased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma potassium levels. Although both therapies tended to reduce 24 h albuminuria, this was significant for the verapamil-trandolapril treatment only.\\ Because the effect of any antihypertensive drug, including diuretics and beta-blockers, on cardiovascular morbidity and on mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients is not known, rational treatment selection can presently be based only on surrogate end-points. Therefore, the triad of metabolic neutrality with antihypertensive and antiproteinuric efficacy supports combined verapamil-trandolapril as a potentially valuable therapy for hypertension accompanying diabetes mellitus.}

   Abstract={The incidence of atrial fibrillation approximately doubled for every 10-year increment in age in the Framingham Heart Study cohort; thus physicians will be faced with an increasing patient population with atrial fibrillation. Hypertension is observed to be the most common associated risk factor in both sexes. The management of patients with atrial fibrillation is evolving as a result of a number of published studies. Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers are emerging as the preferred choices for rate control rather than digoxin. Low-dose anticoagulation therapy has shown beneficial effects not only in primary prevention, but also for secondary prevention of thromboembolism. Thus, patients who cannot be successfully cardioverted should be anticoagulated if there are no contraindications (Table 3) and if they do not fall into the low-risk group--defined as patients under the age of 65 without risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, previous stroke). Patients not eligible for anticoagulation should be on aspirin therapy. Patients with lone atrial fibrillation are not at higher risk for thromboembolism than the general population; therefore, they can be managed without anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Antiarrhythmic treatment should be approached cautiously; amiodarone in low doses is the most effective and safe treatment, but this remains controversial.}

   Abstract={We examined the relationship between streptokinase infusion, intensity of myocardial injury and systemic hypotension in patients receiving streptokinase for treatment of evolving acute myocardial infarction. Twenty consecutive patients treated with streptokinase for evolving acute myocardial infarction received continuous blood pressure and S-T segment monitoring of the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for at least 5 h, commencing prior to commencement of the streptokinase infusion. Aggravation of injury, manifested both by episodic increases in S-T segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) (P < 0.001), and in mean S-T segment elevation (P < 0.05) occurred within the first 20 min after initiation of streptokinase infusion. Hypotension also occurred transiently in most patients, with a mean minimum systolic blood pressure of 92 +/- 22 (S.D.) mmHg occurring 16 +/- 5 min after commencement of streptokinase. There was no correlation between the extent of aggravation of injury and that of hypotension. All patients showed ECG evidence of reperfusion, with a reduction of S-T elevation in the reference lead to 50% of maximal value, after a median of 62 min (range 9-174 min). It is concluded that streptokinase aggravates injury prior to reperfusion, although probably not via the induction of hypotension: It is possible that this effect contributes to the 'early hazard' of thrombolytic therapy.}

   Abstract={Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug which is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat following oral administration, and which has been evaluated primarily for the treatment of hypertension. In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic) [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials, spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with renal failure.}

Although the increase in blood pressure secondary to NSAID use may be only 5 to 10 mm Hg, this increase may be enough to justify a change in medication.

   Abstract={In recent years, substantial investigative attention has focused on therapeutic regimens that could retard the progression of chronic renal insufficiency. Emphasis has been placed on the effects of antihypertensive treatment on renal hemodynamics and preservation of renal function. It has been suggested that some classes of antihypertensive agents may confer a greater renoprotective effect, especially agents that lower glomerular capillary pressure. Conversely, by virtue of their ability to preferentially dilate the afferent arteriole calcium antagonists theoretically could favor an increase in glomerular capillary pressure thereby accelerating the decline of renal function. In this review we survey the literature critically and conclude that in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, calcium antagonists effectively reduce systemic blood pressure while maintaining glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. Preliminary results from a few long-term studies suggest that calcium antagonists may even attenuate the decline in renal function of patients with chronic renal failure. The majority of studies in humans, however, have been nonrandomized, of too short duration, or confounded by investigative difficulties precluding definite conclusions whether calcium antagonists have renoprotective effects. Although the possibility that calcium antagonists may retard progression of renal disease remains to be ascertained, the available evidence indicates that calcium antagonists may be used in patients with renal functional impairment without further exacerbating renal function.}

BP and plasma nifedipine levels were measured at 24, two, four and six hours after dosing. The pattern of BP response to both doses was similar over the 24h period. However, a greater BP lowering effect was achieved with 60 mg compared with 30 mg. The BP lowering effect of both doses was less at 24h after the last dose compared with peak effect. Plasma nifedipine levels were significantly associated with the BP lowering effect in the group as a whole (i.e. the higher the nifedipine levels, the lower the BP) and were significantly less at 24 hours compared with peak. Nifedipine in the coat core formulation is effective in lowering BP in patients with essential hypertension. The 60 mg dose is more effective than the 30 mg dose and induces higher nifedipine levels which are associated with greater BP lowering effect. However, the maximum BP lowering effect is not maintained up to 24 hours.}

The study included 536 general practitioners' practices in England and Wales for the period October 1987 through August 1991. A total of 625,307 persons who received more than 2 million prescriptions for one of 12 NSAIDs were followed up to estimate the risk of newly diagnosed acute liver injury.\\ There were 23 cases of acute liver injury. The incidence of acute liver injury was 3.7 per 100,000 NSAID users or 1.1 per 100,000 NSAID prescriptions. None of the cases had a fatal outcome. Sulindac was the only NSAID with a substantially greater risk than that for the overall NSAID group. Users of NSAIDs who had rheumatoid arthritis had a 10-fold increased risk of acute liver injury compared with NSAID-treated patients with osteoarthritis. Concomitant exposure to other hepatotoxic medications also increased the risk. Transient minor increases in liver test values were not a useful predictor of diagnosed NSAID-associated acute liver injury.\\ Although NSAIDs have been found to be associated with acute liver injury in a small number of persons, the risk is sufficiently small as to be of minimal concern for most NSAIDs.}

Control was defined by the ability to maintain a blood pressure of < or = 160/90 by providing doses of verapamil (max: 480 mg/day) and nifedipine (max: 180 mg/day). Twenty-nine (58%) were black and 21 (42%) were white. Ages ranged from 16 to 84 years. Mean duration of therapy was 1-2 years. Only 3 of 50 (6%) were control failures after providing verapamil and nifedipine. Three of 50 (6%) were discontinued because of side effects--reversible hepatitis (2) and rash (1).

   Abstract={The results of previous studies on the effects of antihypertensive agents on circadian blood pressure patterns are inconclusive, possibly due to the lack of a simple, objective, universally accepted method of quantifying circadian blood pressure profiles. In order to investigate for differences in the effects of antihypertensive drugs on circadian changes we utilised a recently described modified cumulative sums technique to quantify circadian alteration magnitude (CAM). CAM is simply calculated as the difference between crest and trough blood pressures, the mean blood pressures of the 6-h periods of highest and lowest sustained pressures respectively. The records from all 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring performed over a 7 year period on subjects either on no medication (1208), or on treatment with a single first-line antihypertensive agent (578), were examined retrospectively. A sample (n = 40) stratified for trough diastolic blood pressure, age and sex was randomly selected from each of the following 5 groups: subjects on no medication, and subjects being treated with bendrofluazide, atenolol, class 2 calcium-channel blockers or captopril alone. Untreated subjects, those on bendrofluazide and those on a class 2 calcium channel blocker had similar circadian patterns. Subjects on atenolol therapy (25.9 +/- 1.7/18.3 +/- 1.3, systolic CAM +/- SE/diastolic CAM +/- SE) had attenuated circadian changes (p < 0.05) when compared to the untreated group (29.8 +/- 1.8/23.6 +/- 1.1), while those on captopril (34.9 +/- 2.4/25.7 +/- 1.8) exhibited markedly increased systolic and diastolic circadian blood pressure swings, which differed from those of the atenolol treated group (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

Delirium, a medical disorder that results in the morbidity and mortality of the patients, especially in the elderly, is often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. Nurses and other health care professionals need in-depth education about delirium, validated and understandable assessment tools, and astute clinical observational skills. A comprehensive and aggressive clinical management plan that incorporates appropriate pharmacological agents will result in less morbidity and improved long-term outcomes.}

   Abstract={This retrospective study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and cost of two dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.\\ Charts of patients who had been on continuous antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine or felodipine for at least 6 months were reviewed. Analyses include mean changes in blood pressure, percentage of patients achieving blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mm Hg, average dose, and cost per day of the two calcium channel blockers, average cost of additional medication, total medication cost per day, and cost to achieve BP control.\\ Eighty-seven percent of amlodipine-treated patients achieved BP control compared with 33% of felodipine-treated patients. Total medication cost to achieve BP control was 0.87 dollars per day for patients on amlodipine compared with 1.79 dollars per day for patients on felodipine.\\ Amlodipine produced BP control in a greater percentage of patients than did felodipine at a lower total cost to achieve BP control. When evaluating the total cost of antihypertensive treatment, the cost of a drug alone can be misleading.}

   Abstract={The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of amlodipine on neurohormones and oxidative stress in nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and determine the relationship between baseline and posttreatment levels of these markers with survival.\\ Neurohormones and oxidative stress are important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Calcium-channel blockers are associated with poor outcomes in patients with heart failure, in part due to neurohormonal activation. In contrast, amlodipine, a second-generation dihydropyridine, has a more favorable clinical profile.\\ In the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation 2 (PRAISE-2) trial, a subset of 181 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy were randomized to amlodipine (10 mg/day) or placebo. Blood samples were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 26 weeks for norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, dopamine, N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (Nt-pro-ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), adrenolutin and malondialdehyde.\\ There was no difference in levels of neurohormones or oxidative stress markers between the amlodipine and placebo groups at the different times. Both Nt-pro-ANP and BNP decreased at 2 weeks and at 26 weeks. Baseline Nt-pro-ANP correlated with survival in multivariate analysis (P =.001). A strong relationship was found between a reduction in BNP at 26 weeks and survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.153 (95% CI 0.051-0.461, P =.017). No relationship was found between markers of oxidative stress and survival.\\ We conclude that amlodipine does not affect circulating neurohormones and oxidative stress markers in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin and diuretics. In addition, low circulating Nt-pro-ANP and a reduction in BNP over time confers a good prognosis.}

   Abstract={Elevated systolic blood pressure is a more important risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease than elevated diastolic blood pressure. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the predominant form of hypertension in the elderly. Effects of angiotensin II on the vascular wall and endothelium may contribute to development of ISH.\\ The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects on trough sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) of a regimen of losartan, a selective angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, and an amlodipine-based regimen in patients with ISH.\\ This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study consisted of a 4-week placebo phase and an 18-week active-treatment phase. The losartan-based regimen consisted of losartan 50 mg, increased as needed to losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg at week 6 and to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg at week 12 to achieve a target SiSBP <140 mm Hg. the amlodipine-based regimen consisted of amlodipine 5 mg, increased as needed to amlodipine 10 mg at week 6 and to amlodipine 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg at week 12. The primary efficacy measure was change in trough SiSBP from baseline to week 18. Information on the tolerability of study treatments was collected at each visit, including the investigator's and patient's observations of clinical adverse experiences (CAEs), laboratory adverse experiences, and responses to a symptom questionnaire.\\ Eight hundred fifty-seven patients (65.6% female) were randomized to treatment, 432 in the losartan group and 425 in the amlodipine group. Their mean age was 67.6 years, and they had a mean duration of hypertension of 6.7 years at baseline. The losartan and amlodipine groups (intent-to-treat population) had baseline mean SiSBP values of 171.2 and 171.9 mm Hg, respectively. At week 18 (the primary end point), the mean change from baseline in SiSBP was -27.4 mm Hg for 426 patients who received losartan and -28.1 mm Hg for 419 patients who received amlodipine (estimated least-square mean difference, 0.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.4 to 2.0), indicating that losartan's effect on systolic blood pressure was noninferior to that of amlodipine. The proportion of patients who responded (SiSBP <140 mm Hg or a > or =20-mm Hg decrease in SiSBP from baseline) was comparable between groups (73.9% losartan, 75.4% amlodipine). The incidence of CAEs and drug-related CAEs was significantly greater in the amlodipine group (amlodipine, 79.8% and 43.8%, respectively; losartan, 67.8% and 25.5%; P < or = 0.001). In addition, more patients in the amlodipine group discontinued therapy due to a drug-related CAE compared with patients in the losartan group (12.9% vs 4.4%, respectively; P < or = 0.001). Lower-extremity edema was the most common drug-related CAE in the amlodipine group (24.0% amlodipine, 2.5% losartan; P < or = 0.001); dizziness was the most common drug-related CAE in the losartan group (6.0% losartan, 4.0% amlodipine).\\ In these patients with ISH, losartan and amlodipine produced comparable clinically relevant reductions in SiSBP; however, losartan was better tolerated, as evidenced by fewer CAEs and discontinuations compared with amlodipine. Losartan may be considered for the initial treatment of ISH.}

   Abstract={Although there has been increasing recognition that a substantial part of the cardiovascular, central nervous system, and renal conditions induced by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation reflects an action of aldosterone, the potential influence of therapy designed to block aldosterone has been limited by the fact that spironolactone (until recently the only aldosterone antagonist available) exerts a substantial array of adverse effects. We sought to compare the magnitude of the distress induced by a widely used calcium channel blocking agent, amlodipine, and a new aldosterone antagonist, eplerenone, in patients treated for systolic hypertension.\\ A total of 269 patients older than 50 years with systolic hypertension were randomized to either eplerenone, 50 mg/d, or amlodipine, 2.5 mg/d, and titrated to a maximum 200-mg eplerenone dose or 10-mg amlodipine dose. Patients were followed up for 24 weeks. Quality-of-life questionnaires (SF-36 Health Survey) and a validated instrument for assessing symptom distress (Symptom Distress Index) were administered at randomization and 24 weeks after starting treatment.\\ The systolic blood pressure response to eplerenone and amlodipine did not differ (eplerenone = -20.5 mm Hg and amlodipine = -20.1 mm Hg). For the quality-of-life analysis, 119 patients were randomized to eplerenone and 122 to amlodipine. No significant treatment group differences in the Symptom Distress Index were detected at baseline. There was an overall significant treatment effect on symptom distress in favor of eplerenone (P =.03). Indeed, Symptom Distress Index showed significant worsening distress in 36 of 71 symptoms in the amlodipine arm and none in the eplerenone arm. Significant treatment effect in favor of eplerenone was observed in 5 symptoms: ankle swelling, weight gain, nocturia, increased urination, and shortness of breath. Patients with symptom distress also showed an erosion of psychosocial measures of quality of life (P<.001).\\ The aldosterone antagonist eplerenone is substantially better tolerated than the widely used calcium-channel blocking agent amlodipine, with comparable reductions in systolic blood pressure. This feature should improve therapeutics in patients in whom blockade of aldosterone's effect would be helpful.}

Of 13,449 patients, 92% (N = 12,398) received antihypertensive therapy at baseline. The baseline BP was 153.5/86.9 mm Hg in treated compared to 168.1.8/95.3 mm Hg in 1051 untreated patients. After 6 months both groups had indistinguishable BP values. At 12 months the BP decreased to 141.2/82.9 mm Hg (P <.0001 for systolic BP and diastolic BP versus baseline), at 24 months to 139.1/80 mm Hg (P <.0001 v 12 months), and to 138/79 mm Hg at 30 months (P <.0001 v 24 months). The systolic BP control (<140 mm Hg) at 30 months increased from 21.9% at baseline to 62.2%, the diastolic BP (< 90 mm Hg) from 54.2% to 90.2% and the combined control (<140 and <90 mm Hg) from 18.9% to 60.5%. At 24 months 85.8% of patients were on protocol drugs: monotherapy = 39.7%, added hydrochlorothiazide = 26.6%, add-on drugs = 15.1%, and protocol drugs in nonstandard doses = 4.3%.\\ The achieved BP control exceeds values reported in most published large-scale trials. The VALUE study is executed in regular clinical settings and 92% of the patients received antihypertensive drugs at baseline. When an explicit BP goal is set, and a treatment algorithm is provided, the physicians can achieve better control rates than in their regular practice.}

   Abstract={This study investigates the effect of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist CRL42796 in a canine model of carotid artery thrombosis. Both carotid arteries developed occlusive thrombosis in each of the five control animals (time to occlusion: right carotid artery, 92.6 minutes; left carotid artery, 89.0 minutes). A single oral dose of CRL42796 (3 mg/kg) prevented occlusive thrombosis in 4 of 6 vessels and increased time to thrombosis, albeit not significantly (right carotid artery, 134.1 minutes; left carotid artery, 145.0 minutes). When the initial dose of CRL42796 was followed by a second oral dose (3 mg/kg) 2 hours later, 10 of 10 carotid arteries remained patent throughout the period of electrolytic injury. CRL42796 reduced thrombus weight in both treatment protocols. Ex vivo platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid (AA) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was reduced at 120, 240, and 360 minutes after two doses of CRL42796. A single oral dose reduced ADP-induced responses at 240 and 360 minutes, but significant effects were not observed with AA. Bleeding time increased 360 minutes after two oral doses of CRL42796, but not at 120 minutes. Bleeding time was unchanged with the single dose of CRL42796. The results demonstrate that oral administration of CRL42796 prevents carotid artery thrombosis in response to deep vessel wall injury and may have potential value to be characterized in extended preclinical and clinical study.}

We compared short-term and 1-year blood pressure response by BMI category and weight change with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, diltiazem-SR, captopril, clonidine, prazosin, or placebo in 1292 male veterans. Drug doses were titrated to achieve goal diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg over 4-8 weeks. Patients who achieved goal blood pressure were maintained for 1 year. BMI did not predict change in systolic, diastolic or pulse pressures during titration for any drug. At 1 year obese patients (BMI >30) were 2.5 times more likely to have diastolic blood pressure controlled by atenolol than normal weight (BMI <27) patients (p=0.01). Only prazosin patients gained weight: 1.7 lb (end-titration, p<0.0001; 1-year, p=0.02). Obesity does not appear to cause resistance to antihypertensive medications.}

   Abstract={Serial decline in electrocardiographic voltage in patients with increased left ventricular mass has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events.\\ We studied 468 patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension in the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial. Patients were randomized in a stratified design to receive initial treatment with either enalapril or nisoldipine and to either intensive or moderate treatment goals. We measured an electrocardiographic index for increased left ventricular mass, the adjusted Cornell voltage, serially by treatment group. The association between changes in electrocardiographic voltage and cardiovascular events was defined with Cox proportional hazards analysis.\\ In 5 years of follow-up, the decline in adjusted Cornell voltage was significantly greater for patients treated with enalapril than for patients treated with nisoldipine (repeated measures analysis of variance P =.002). In the Cox proportional hazards model, treatment assignment (enalapril vs nisoldipine) was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular events, but the presence of coronary disease at baseline, the duration of diabetes mellitus, and change in voltage were also independent predictors of cardiovascular events.\\ In the ABCD study, enalapril treatment was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction. The reduction in left ventricular mass as reflected by diminished electrocardiographic voltage may explain some, but not all, of the effect of enalapril in this study.}

   Abstract={The pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and transient myocardial ischemia (TMI) is not completely understood. Therefore, the authors studied the biological indicators of thrombogenesis and sympathetic activity. The study was conducted on 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 30 patients with stable angina pectoris. Treatment was standardized with low-molecular-weight heparin and 300 mg aspirin/day but with no IIb/IIIa inhibitors, an oral beta-blocker, diltiazem 60 mg tid, glyceryl trinitrate i.v. in patients with ACS but with mononitrates orally and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with stable angina. Twenty-four-hour continuous ECG monitoring and ST segment analysis were performed on day 2 of admission and heart rate analysis was performed 10, 5, and 1 minute before and during the myocardial ischemia periods. Blood sampling for von Willebrand factor (vWf) determination was performed through a peripheral vein at 8 AM, noon, 6 PM and 10 PM and half an hour after the description of angina. The patients with ACS were grouped as transient myocardial ischemia positive (n = 20) and negative (n = 30). The patients with stable angina were designated as the control group (n = 30). The detected vWf levels at 4 different daytime periods in patients with ACS were significantly higher than those in patients with stable angina. At the 6 PM to 10 PM period, the vWf level increase was significantly higher in patients with TMI than in the patients without TMI. At the 8 AM to noon period, the detected vWf levels decreased significantly in both TMI groups. During the nocturnal ischemia periods, the increase in vWf levels immediately after angina was significantly more apparent than the detected changes during daytime ischemia. Analysis showed that heart rates before the ischemia during stable angina episodes were significantly higher than those in TMI (-) (silent) angina. The heart rate difference between 10 minutes before and during the ischemia in the angina group was significantly different from that during TMI (-) (silent) ischemia. The heart rates at the times related to ischemia in the nocturnal period were significantly lower than those in the daytime period. The heart rate differences between the ischemia-related times and during the ischemia were significantly higher in daytime ischemic attacks than in nocturnal ischemic attacks. The study confirms that the vWf level, which is an indicator of thrombogenesis, was significantly increased in patients with ACS. Nocturnal ischemia is associated with thrombogenesis. Daytime ischemia is associated with increased sympathetic activity, and symptomatic ischemia is usually associated with increased sympathetic activity.}

Patients being recruited were openly randomised to amlodipine or nifedipine retard. Ambulatory 24-h BP and echocardiogram (in 42 patients) were measured before and 1 year after treatment. At the end of study, there was 17% reduction in systolic BP; 17% reduction in diastolic BP and 12% reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine). Of the 42 subjects underwent echocardiograms, eight became 'new-dippers' at the end of study (non-dippers before treatment and restored nocturnal fall of MAP> or =10% after treatment). The other 34 patients were either non-dippers before and after treatment (n=27); dippers before and after treatment (n=3) or dippers before treatment and non-dippers after treatment (n=4). The eight 'new-dippers' had improved ejection fraction (69.6+/-7.2 to 75.8+/-7.4%, P<0.05) and increased left ventricular diastolic diameter (43.7+/-7.9 to 47.9+/-8.8 mm, P<0.05) after the 1-year treatment of calcium antagonist. Compared to the other 34 subjects, the eight 'new-dippers' showed significant improvement in ejection fraction (9.4+/-10.9 vs. -1.2+/-11.8%, P<0.05). In conclusion, both amlodipine and nifedipine retard are effective in controlling the 24-h BP in Chinese hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. For those who have restored nocturnal dip in BP have significantly increased left ventricular systolic ejection fraction after 1-year treatment of long acting calcium antagonists. The clinical significance and underlying mechanisms require further studies.}

This randomized, double-blind study compared the antihypertensive efficacy of the starting dose of olmesartan medoxomil with that of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate (amlodipine) in subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 440 subjects aged >/=18 years were randomized to the starting dose of olmesartan medoxomil (20 mg/day), amlodipine (5 mg/day), or placebo for 8 weeks. Subjects were evaluated by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and by seated cuff blood pressure (BP) measurements at trough. The primary end point was the change from baseline in mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ABPM at Week 8. Secondary end points included change from baseline in mean 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 8 weeks, change from baseline in mean seated trough cuff DBP and SBP measurements, and response and control rates for DBP <90 and <85 mmHg. Control rates for SBP <140 and <130 mmHg were also calculated. Olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine produced significantly greater reductions in ambulatory and seated DBP and SBP compared with placebo. Mean reductions in ambulatory and seated BP were similar between the two active agents; however, in the olmesartan medoxomil group, significantly more patients achieved the SBP goal of <130 mmHg and the DBP goal of <85 mmHg. Both drugs were well tolerated at the recommended starting dose. Although amlodipine was associated with a higher incidence of oedema, this did not reach statistical significance. Olmesartan medoxomil is an effective antihypertensive agent, with BP-lowering efficacy at the starting dose similar to that of amlodipine, and is associated with more patients achieving the rigorous BP goals of SBP <130 mmHg and DBP <85 mmHg.}

   Abstract={To compare the effect of antihypertensive drugs on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the peripheral conduit arteries of patients with essential hypertension, in a prospective, randomized, parallel group study, endothelial function was assessed in 168 hypertensive patients before and after 6-month treatment with randomly assigned nifedipine GITS (30 to 60 mg, n=28), amlodipine (5 to 10 mg, n=28), atenolol (50 to 100 mg, n=29), nebivolol (5 to 10 mg, n=28), telmisartan (80 to 160 mg, n=29), and perindopril (2 to 4 mg, n=28). If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (high-resolution ultrasound) compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 microg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automatic computerized analysis. Forty healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. Oxidative stress production was evaluated by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P<0.01) lower flow-mediated dilation (5.2+/-1.9%) as compared with healthy control subjects (7.1+/-2.6%). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments similarly reduced blood pressure, but only perindopril increased flow mediated dilation (from 5.1+/-2 to 6.4+/-2.4%; P<0.01) without modifying the response to glyceryl trinitrate. Perindopril but also telmisartan nifedipine and amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity. In patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibitors appear to be the only compounds able to improve conduit artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation.}

   Abstract={We investigated the adequacy of treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, and assessed the temporal trends in adherence to published guidelines.\\ We performed a post hoc analysis of 501 patients enrolled in the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial. All patients had fasting lipid profiles at baseline and during the 5 years (1993 to 1998) of the trial. Achieving the National Cholesterol Education Panel's goals for hyperlipidemia management was the primary outcome.\\ The percentage of patients with a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level less than 130 mg/dL was 53% (n = 266) at baseline and 54% (n = 270) at the end of 5 years (P = 0.75). Almost 14% (n = 69) of these patients continued to have an LDL cholesterol level greater than 160 mg/dL at the completion of the study. Only 19% (n = 25) of the 133 patients with known coronary artery disease had an LDL cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL at baseline, and only 16% (n = 21) achieved this level at the completion of the study (P = 0.37).\\ Although prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes is a public health priority, our results suggest that hyperlipidemia is being treated suboptimally.}

   Abstract={Eplerenone is a highly selective aldosterone blocker, which is under development for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. To assess its usefulness in older patients with systolic hypertension and widened pulse pressure, we compared the effects of eplerenone with amlodipine, on clinic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure and in a subset of the patients, ambulatory BP, vascular compliance, and urinary albumin excretion. The study involved 269 patients > or =50 years of age who were randomly assigned to either eplerenone (50 to 200 mg daily) or amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg daily) in a double-blind titration to effect design. After 24 weeks of therapy, reductions in clinic systolic BP were similar for both treatments (eplerenone, -20.5+/-1.1 mm Hg; amlodipine, -20.1+/-1.1 mm Hg). Reductions in clinic diastolic BP were modestly larger on amlodipine (-6.9+/-0.7 mm Hg) compared with eplerenone (-4.5+/-0.7 mm Hg) (P=0.014). Pulse pressure was also reduced similarly from baseline by the 2 treatment groups (eplerenone, -15.9 mm Hg versus amlodipine, -13.4 mm Hg, P=0.07). Changes from baseline in pulse wave velocity after 24 weeks of therapy were statistically similar for eplerenone and amlodipine. In patients with microalbuminuria at baseline (>30 mg albumin/g creatinine), eplerenone reduced the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio by 52% compared with a reduction of 10% by amlodipine (P=0.04). Thus, eplerenone was as effective as amlodipine in lowering systolic BP and pulse pressure as well as pulse wave velocity in older patients with widened pulse pressure hypertension. Furthermore, eplerenone reduced microalbuminuria to a greater extent than amlodipine in this older patient group.}

   Abstract={Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a clinicopathological condition that comprises a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis represents only a stage within the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and is defined pathologically by the presence of steatosis together with necro-inflammatory activity. The true prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unknown, but it is estimated that it affects 10-24% of the general population in different countries. The diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is based upon convincing evidence of absent or minimal alcohol consumption, compatible histological changes in liver biopsy and the exclusion of other liver diseases. The natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease remains to be defined. Patients with pure steatosis on liver biopsy follow a relatively benign course, whereas patients with histological necro-inflammatory changes and/or fibrosis may progress to end-stage liver disease. An initial step in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the management of associated conditions, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients with steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis on liver biopsy may benefit from investigational pharmacological therapy. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may be candidates for liver transplantation.}

   Abstract={A 90-day, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted to compare the efficacy of amlodipine (once a day) with nicardipine (two to three times a day), in the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in the elderly. Patients (n = 133) aged > or = 60 years, with ISH were randomized to receive either amlodipine 5 mg/day, or nicardipine 60 mg/day (titrated if necessary to 10 mg/day and 100 mg/day, respectively) for 90 days. Efficacy was assessed by measuring office blood pressure (BP), and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The two treatments substantially and comparably reduced office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP), and also produced a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Amlodipine reduced SBP, as assessed by ABPM, to a significantly greater extent than nicardipine. Both treatments were well-tolerated. The sustained effect of amlodipine, compared with nicardipine, was reflected in its significantly greater antihypertensive activity, particularly during the nocturnal period, as assessed by ABPM. The study demonstrates that once a day dose of amlodipine is an effective antihypertensive treatment for elderly ISH patients.}

   Abstract={The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of combination therapy using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor lisinopril and the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine GITS on the degree and homogeneity of 24-hour blood pressure reduction in essential hypertensive patients. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 51 patients (mean age, 54.4 +/- 9.4 years) with essential hypertension and clinic diastolic blood pressure between 105 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 4-week treatment with lisinopril (20 mg), nifedipine GITS (30 mg), or their combination according to a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Trough clinic blood pressure and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were measured at the end of the run-in period and after 4 weeks of treatment. In addition to clinic and 24-hour average blood pressure reduction, the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index, a new measure for the homogeneity of blood pressure reduction, were also calculated. Although both lisinopril and nifedipine GITS produced a significant reduction in clinic and 24-hour average blood pressure values, the reduction obtained with the combination was significantly (P < 0.001) greater. Moreover, the combination therapy increased (P < 0.01) the smoothness index as compared with each single drug for both systolic (lisinopril, 1.02; nifedipine GITS, 1.1; combination, 1.76) and diastolic (lisinopril, 0.98; nifedipine GITS, 0.87; combination, 1.54) blood pressure values, whereas trough-to-peak ratio values (expressed as median) for systolic (lisinopril, 0.41; nifedipine GITS, 0.52; combination, 0.55) and diastolic (lisinopril, 0.35; nifedipine GITS, 0.40; combination, 0.49) blood pressure values were not significantly increased by the combination therapy. Thus, antihypertensive treatment with the combination of lisinopril and nifedipine GITS is more effective and balanced over the 24 hours than the combination components administered alone, confirming that the smoothness index is superior to the trough-to-peak ratio in assessing homogeneity of pharmacologic blood pressure reduction.}

   Abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of benazepril addition to amlodipine antihypertensive treatment on ankle-foot volume (AFV) and pretibial subcutaneous tissue pressure (PSTP), two objective measures of ankle oedema. A total of 32 mild to moderate essential hypertensives (DBP>90 and <110 mmHg), aged 30-70 years were studied. After a 4-week placebo period, they were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or benazepril 10 mg o.d. or amlodipine 5 mg plus benazepril 10 mg o.d. for 4 weeks, according to a crossover design. At the end of the placebo period and of each active treatment period, blood pressure,AFV and PSTP were evaluated. AFV was measured using the principle of water displacement. PSTP was assessed using a system, the subcutaneous pretibial interstitial environment with a water manometer. Both amlodipine and benazepril monotherapy significantly reduced SBP (-18.2+/-4 and -17.8+/-4 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01 vs baseline) and DBP (-12.1+/-3 and -11.7+/-3 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01); the reduction was increased by the combination (-24.2+/-5 mmHg for SBP, P<0.001 and -16.8+/-4 mmHg for DBP, P<0.001). Amlodipine monotherapy significantly increased both AFV (+17.1%, P<0.001 vs baseline) and PSTP (+56.6%, P<0.001 vs baseline). As compared to amlodipine alone, the combination produced a less pronounced increase in AFV (+5.5%, P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine) and PSTP (+20.5%, P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine). Ankle oedema was clinically evident in 11 patients with amlodipine monotherapy and in three patients with the combination. These results suggest that ACE-inhibitors partially counteract the microcirculatory changes responsible for Ca-antagonists-induced oedema formation.}

   Abstract={Antihypertensive treatment with dihydropyridines may be accompanied by sympathetic activation. Data on whether this is common to all compounds and similar in the various phases of treatment are not univocal, however. In 28 untreated essential hypertensives (age, 56.4+/-1.8 years; mean+/-SEM) finger blood pressure (BP, Finapres), heart rate (HR, ECG), plasma norepinephrine (NE, high-performance liquid chromatography), and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA, microneurography) were measured at rest and during baroreceptor manipulation (vasoactive drugs) in the placebo run-in period and after randomization to double-blind acute and chronic (8 weeks) felodipine (10 mg/d, n=14) or lercanidipine (10 mg/d, n=14). Acute administration of both drugs induced pronounced BP reductions and marked increases in HR, NE, and MSNA. After 8 weeks of treatment, BP reductions were similar to those observed after acute administration, whereas HR, NE, and MSNA responses were markedly attenuated (-7%, -32%, and -14%, respectively; P<0.05). There was a small residual increase in sympathetic activity in the felodipine group, whereas in the lercanidipine group, all adrenergic markers returned to baseline values. Baroreflex control of HR and MSNA was markedly impaired (-42% and -48%, respectively) after acute drug administration, with a recovery and complete resetting during chronic treatment. Thus, the sympathoexcitation induced by 2 different dihydropyridines is largely limited to the acute administration. The 2 drugs have, nevertheless, a different chronic sympathetic effect, indicating that dihydropyridines do not homogeneously affect this function. The acute sympathoexcitation, but not the small between-drugs differential chronic adrenergic effect, is accounted for by baroreflex impairment.}

   Abstract={Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and diabetes are both associated with a high risk of ischemic events, but the role of intensive blood pressure control in PAD has not been established.\\ The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes study followed 950 subjects with type 2 diabetes for 5 years; 480 of the subjects were normotensive (baseline diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg). Patients randomized to placebo (moderate blood pressure control) had a mean blood pressure of 137+/-0.7/81+/-0.3 mm Hg over the last 4 years of treatment. In contrast, patients randomized to intensive treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine had a mean 4-year blood pressure of 128+/-0.8/75+/-0.3 mm Hg (P<0.0001 compared with moderate control). PAD, which is defined as an ankle-brachial index <0.90 at the baseline visit, was diagnosed in 53 patients. In patients with PAD, there were 3 cardiovascular events (13.6%) on intensive treatment compared with 12 events (38.7%) on moderate treatment (P=0.046). After adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, an inverse relationship between ankle-brachial index and cardiovascular events was observed with moderate treatment (P=0.009), but not with intensive treatment (P=0.91). Thus, with intensive blood pressure control, the risk of an event was not increased, even at the lowest ankle-brachial index values, and was the same as in a patient without PAD.\\ In PAD patients with diabetes, intensive blood pressure lowering to a mean of 128/75 mm Hg resulted in a marked reduction in cardiovascular events.}

   Abstract={This study was designed to test the hypothesis that plasma concentrations of matrix metallo-proteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), two enzymes that share similar substrate specificity (collagen type IV and V), possibly related to vascular remodelling, are altered in essential hypertension. The second aim of the study was to assess whether chronic antihypertensive treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine would normalize these alterations. To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma concentrations of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 42 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and in 25 normotensive control subjects. Measurements were repeated after 6 months of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Baseline values of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were decreased (P=0.01 and 0.002, respectively) in hypertensive patients compared with normotensives. Hypertensive patients with systemic vascular resistances <1440 dyn s/cm(5) exhibited higher values of MMP-2 (P=0.005) and MMP-9 (P=0.001) than hypertensive patients with systemic vascular resistances >1440 dyn s/cm(5). Treated patients attained a nonsignificant increase in MMP-2 plasma concentrations, but a significant increase in MMP-9 plasma concentrations (P=0.01) compared to respective values before treatment. In conclusion, these findings suggest that plasma concentrations of active MMP-2 and MMP-9, mainly related to vascular extracellular matrix metabolism, are depressed in patients with essential hypertension. A 6 month treatment with amlodipine can normalize MMP-9 but not MMP-2 plasma concentrations. The hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment may modulate collagen metabolism remains to be determined by further studies.}

   Abstract={Treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with either dacarbazine (DTIC) or interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) as single drugs, or in combination, results in a response rate of approximately 15-20%. This study evaluated the activity and toxicity following treatment with a combination of DTIC, IFNalpha2b and verapamil (VPL). Thirty patients with disseminated metastatic melanoma received DTIC 250 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 of a 4 week schedule, IFNalpha2b 3 MIU on days 1-5 each week, and VPL 80 mg three times a day throughout the cycle, until either disease progression or serious toxicity was observed. Among the 28 evaluable patients, there were four complete responses (CRs), five partial responses (PRs) and eight patients with stable disease (SD). The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 32%. Two patients with a CR were long-term survivors (45 and 34 months) and a third is still in complete remission after 49 months. The fourth CR patient relapsed and died with progressive brain metastases after 8 months. Among the eight patients with SD, one survived for 22 months and another for 34 months. Despite one toxic death, these results suggest that this treatment regimen is well tolerated and seems to be more effective than DTIC alone in a subset of patients. A controlled randomized study would be required to determine the value of adding VPL and IFNalpha2b to DTIC.}

No adverse drug reaction was noted.\\ ACE-I (enalapril) provided protection against the progression of renal insufficiency in patients of MPGN having hypertension with mild to moderate renal impairment. The renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitor (enalapril) is associated with substantial decrease in albuminuria.}

Inhibition of the HMG-CoA pathway and of calcium channels improves endothelial function experimentally and in the forearm circulation. Thus, we investigated the effects of a statin and/or a calcium antagonist on coronary endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\\ In 343 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in 29 centers, acetylcholine (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L) was infused in a coronary segment without angiographically significant CAD. Changes in coronary diameter were measured by quantitative angiography. Endothelium-independent responses were assessed by intracoronary adenosine (1.2 mg/mL) and nitroglycerin (250 microg). Thereafter, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to placebo, cerivastatin 0.4 mg/d, nifedipine 30 to 60 mg/d, or their combination. Studies were repeated at 6 months. In the most constricted segment, nifedipine but not cerivastatin reduced vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (18.8% versus placebo 10.0%; P<0.05). Patients not taking ACE inhibitors showed a smaller improvement in the placebo group (6.0%), but nifedipine still had an effect (17.0%; P<0.05 versus placebo). Analysis of all evaluable coronary segments revealed an 11% reduction of acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction in patients receiving nifedipine and cerivastatin (P<0.05 versus placebo). Cerivastatin lowered LDL cholesterol by 35% (P<0.001).\\ The ENCORE I trial demonstrates that multicenter studies on coronary endothelial function are feasible. After 6 months' treatment, nifedipine improved coronary endothelial function in the most constricted segment. The combination of nifedipine and cerivastatin tended to improve endothelial function; however, this only reached significance in an analysis of all coronary segments.}

   Abstract={The aim of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study was to compare cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in calcium-antagonist-based treatment with diltiazem and conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based treatment in essential hypertension. The objective of the present sub-study was to compare self-measured home blood pressure with office blood pressure at a time-point in the study when the patients' blood pressures had been treated to the level that the investigators conceived to be the blood pressure target. The NORDIL study was prospective, randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled 10881 patients aged 50-74 years at health centers in Norway and Sweden who had diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 100 mmHg or more. The present sub-study group (n = 87) was small but fairly representative for the entire study population regarding baseline characteristics. Both systolic (4.0 mmHg, p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressures (3.1 mmHg, p < 0.001) were significantly lower at home than in the office. Pearson correlation coefficients between the respective office and home readings were statistically highly significant (p < 0.001), but of moderate strength ranging from r = 0.41 for heart rate to r = 0.46 and r = 0.58 for diastolic and systolic blood pressures, respectively. Altman plots also gave statistical support to some inconsistency between the two methods of measurements. Pearson correlation coefficients between afternoon and morning measurements showed strong relationships with r-values >0.9 for both blood pressures and heart rate. The Altman plots also suggested excellent consistency between afternoon and morning measurements. Thus, motivated and trained hypertensive patients can perform home recordings of blood pressure and heart rate with precision; however, there are differences between recordings at home and in the investigators' offices that suggest some degree of "white coat effect" in these treated hypertensives.}

   Abstract={Recent meta-analyses suggest that once-daily dihydropyridines and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors cause similar decreases in left ventricular (LV) mass for comparable decreases in blood pressure (BP). However, some dihydropyridines, such as felodipine-extended release (ER), still increase sympathetic activity and may, therefore, be less effective in decreasing LV mass.\\ To evaluate the effects of long term antihypertensive treatment with nifedipine-gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and felodipine-ER compared with enalapril on LV mass relative to the extent of BP control (assessed by 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring) and sympathetic activity (assessed by plasma catecholamine concentrations).\\ Enalapril was started at 10 mg/day, felodipine-ER at 5 mg/day and nifedipine-GITS at 30 mg/day, all once daily. Doses were increased to 20 mg/day, 10 mg/day or 60 mg/day, respectively, if the office BP remained 160/90 mmHg or greater at the end of the dosing interval. Evaluable echocardiograms were obtained for 116 patients at the end of the study (30 weeks of treatment).\\ On 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring, nifedipine-GITS caused a consistent decrease in BP throughout the 24 h dosing interval, whereas felodipine-ER caused a more marked fall in BP during the day, and enalapril's effects diminished during the night and had disappeared by the morning. Only felodipine-ER significantly increased supine and standing plasma noradrenaline by more than 50% similarly after six, 18, and 30 weeks of treatment. In BP responders (decrease in systolic BP 10 mmHg or greater), enalapril and nifedipine-GITS caused clear decreases in LV mass by 12 to 16 g/m2, whereas felodipine-ER was less effective (decrease by only 6 g/m2, P<0.01 versus enalapril).\\ Once-daily dihydropyridines should not be regarded as one homogeneous class and, compared with felodipine-ER, nifedipine-GITS exhibits a better profile regarding 24 h BP control, sympathetic activation and regression of LV mass.}

Bedtime GRD 360 mg was associated with a significantly greater reduction in mean DBP between 6 AM and 12 noon compared to morning GRD 360 mg with a least squares mean for treatment difference of -3.3 mm Hg (P =.0004). Similar dose-related and significant reductions in systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were obtained. Incidence of adverse events (AEs) for all GRD groups (44.5%) was less than that obtained for the placebo group (49.3%). The 540-mg group showed an incidence of AEs (43.5%) similar to that observed for the 240-mg group (42.6%).\\ The GRD dose-dependently significantly reduces BP and HR over the 24-h interval after once-daily bedtime dosing. Further greater reductions were obtained between 6 AM and 12 noon, when circadian BP is highest, compared to morning administration of the same dose. The 540-mg GRD was safe, well tolerated, and offers further therapeutic option for patients with severe hypertension who required additional BP control.}

   Abstract={Prevalence of white-coat hypertension varies approximately 20 per cent among mild hypertensives. When white-coat hypertensives are prescribed antihypertensive medication, there is usually a decrease in clinic blood pressure (BP), but little or no change in 24 hours blood pressure (ABPM). The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that efficacy of medication therapy for hypertension is identical in any grading of severity of baseline blood pressure. The authors retrospectively analysed ABPM data from mild to moderate hypertensive patients. Efficacy in decreasing blood pressure by antihypertensives has linear relation to baseline blood pressure. Response to antihypertensive agents in white-coat hypertension is minimal but a significant effect still persists and the possibility of hypotensive adverse events from medication in the case cannot be overlooked.}

   Abstract={Hypertensive hemodialysis patients noncompliant for their medications do not benefit from pharmacologic advances in the treatment of high blood pressure, and increase their already high risk of cardiovascular complications. The medical staff often becomes frustrated by severe hypertension in those who refuse to take medicines at home, drink excessive fluids, miss multiple dialysis sessions and sign-off dialysis early. In addition to addressing the psychosocial, financial, educational and substance abuse problems which contribute to noncompliance, we have developed a medication strategy to serve as an at least interim means of lowering blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents which have long half-lives in renal failure (lisinopril) and/or are intrinsically long acting (transdermal clonidine and amlodipine) were administered on dialysis days by the unit personnel to those patients who did not or would not take that or any dose on their own. The lisinopril and amlodipine were assured to have been taken on at least the dialysis days (thrice weekly), and the clonidine patch replaced weekly. Sixteen patients were thus treated when they failed to reliably self-administer medications. They had a significant decline in the predialysis systolic pressure of 15 mm Hg (175 +/- 6 to 160 +/- 5 mm Hg), diastolic of 12 mm Hg (103 +/- 3 to 91 +/- 3 mm Hg), and mean pressure of 13 mm Hg (127 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 4 mm Hg). There was an improvement in post-dialysis bood pressures, with the mean pressure declining 13 mm Hg from 110 +/- 4 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg. Many individuals had erratic blood pressure control, having intermittently missed dialysis and hence unit-administered medicine, as well as continued fluid or drug abuse. The patients had uniformly excellent acceptance of this regimen, even spontaneously requesting it, and had no appreciable adverse effects. In summary while noncompliance is being addressed by the entire medical team, dialysis unit administration of long-acting medicines helps many hypertensive dialysis patients who would otherwise be at increased risk for severe cardiovascular complications.}

   Abstract={Nisoldipine (N) is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist marketed as a racemic mixture and used for the treatment of hypertension. In the present study, we investigated the influence of type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on the enantioselective pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameters of N.\\ Seventeen hypertensive patients, nine of them with DM, were investigated in a cross-over study with administration of rac-N as coat-core tablets (20 mg day(-1)) or placebo for 15 days each. Serial blood samples (0-24 h) were collected on the 15th day, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was simultaneously evaluated. N enantiomers in plasma samples were analysed using chiral high-performance liquid chromatography combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The enantiomeric ratios differing from one were evaluated using the Wilcoxon test, and the results are reported as means with the 95% confidence intervals. A lidocaine (L) test was carried out as an in vivo marker of CYP3A4 (and CYP1A2) activities.\\ The following differences were observed between the (+)-N and (-)-N enantiomers, respectively, in the patients presenting with DM (means and ranges): C(max) 3.9 (1.7-6.1) ng ml(-1) versus 0.7 (0.4-1.0) ng ml(-1), AUC(0-24) 51.5 (29.0-74.0) ng ml(-1) h versus 9.4 (5.9-12.8) ng ml(-1) h, and Cl/f 3.6 (1.9-5.4) l h(-1) kg(-1) versus 18.7 (11.7-25.7) l h(-1) kg(-1). The Cl/f value of (+)-N was lower (Mann-Whitney test) in patients with DM: 6.0 (4.3-7.5) l h(-1) kg(-1) versus 3.6 (1.9-5.4) l h(-1) kg(-1). The same observation was made for the (-)-N, with Cl/f reaching 38.8 (26.8-51.0) l h(-1) kg(-1) and 18.7 (11.7-25.7) l h(-1) kg(-1) for the non-diabetic and DM groups, respectively. The L test resulted in higher ratios (P < 0.05) of plasma L/MEGX concentrations (30 min after i.v. L) for DM (11.1 vs 18.6). N significantly reduced systolic and diastolic BP (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test) in all patients investigated relative to placebo. No differences in BP reduction were observed between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. N significantly increased noradrenaline concentrations in plasma of both patient groups. The data also demonstrated that the plasma concentrations of noradrenaline 30 min after N administration were lower (P < 0.05) in diabetic (mean 2.86 pmol ml(-1)) than in non-diabetic patients (4.80 pmol ml(-1)).\\ The present data permit us to infer that type-2 diabetes mellitus alters the kinetic disposition of the (+)-N eutomer and (-)-N distomer, presumably due to a lower activity of CYP3A4, although it does not modify the clinical effect brought about by the reduction in BP.}

   Abstract={To compare the effects of four antihypertensive drugs, which have reportedly different effectiveness in reducing myocardial mass.\\ A randomized, double-blind, prospective study included 80 hypertensive patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy confirmed both electrocardiographically and echocardiographically. We investigated the effects of indapamide, nicardipine, propranolol, and chlorthalidone on arterial blood pressure and LV mass and function.\\ Sixty-four patients (34 men and 30 women) completed the 6-month study. No significant differences in antihypertensive effects of the four medications were found. The average decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 12.8% and 10.4%, respectively. All four antihypertensive medications caused pronounced reduction in LV mass, between 7.9% in the propranolol group and 10.1% in the nicardipine group, with no significant difference between the groups. In patients receiving diuretics, predominant decrease was observed in LV mass and LV mass index. In patients treated with propranolol, the thickness of both the LV wall and interventricular septum was reduced, whereas the reduction in LV mass, LV wall and interventricular septum thickness was found in patients treated with nicardipine. There was no significant correlation between the changes in LV mass and other variables (blood pressure, and systolic and diastolic function). Systolic function did not improve with the reversion of LV hypertrophy in any group of patients, but improvement was observed in some indices of diastolic function. The early and late LV filling velocity and their ratio did not improve significantly, either. Clinically relevant side effects were not observed.\\ All four antihypertensive monotherapies achieved a comparable control of hypertension and reduction in LV hypertrophy.}

   Abstract={Primary aldosteronism is a specifically treatable and potentially curable form of secondary hypertension. The aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is routinely used as a screening test. Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with the interpretation of this parameter, but a correct washout period can be potentially harmful. We have investigated the effects of therapy with atenolol, amlodipine, doxazosin, fosinopril, and irbesartan on the ARR in a group of 230 patients with suspected primary aldosteronism. The percent change from control of ARR in patients taking amlodipine was -17%+/-32; atenolol, 62%+/-82; doxazosin, -5%+/-26; fosinopril, -30%+/-24; and irbesartan, -43%+/-27. The ARR change induced by atenolol was significantly higher compared with that induced by all other drugs (P<0.0001), and the ARR change induced by irbesartan was significantly lower than that induced by doxazosin (P<0.0001). One of 55 patients from the group taking amlodipine (1.8%) and 4/17 of the patients taking irbesartan (23.5%) gave a false-negative ARR (<50). None of the patients of the groups taking fosinopril, doxazosin, and atenolol displayed a false-negative ARR. Doxazosin and fosinopril can be used in hypertensive patients who need to undergo aldosterone and PRA measurement for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; amlodipine gave a very small percentage of false-negative diagnoses. beta-Blockers also do not interfere with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, but they can be responsible for an increased rate of false-positive ARRs. The high rate of false-negative diagnoses in patients undergoing irbesartan treatment requires confirmation in a higher number of patients.}

   Abstract={Suboptimal management of hypertension is often a result of poor patient compliance in the form of missed doses of their antihypertensive medication. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial was designed to compare the persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of the amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) after two 'missed doses', and also to compare the drugs' overall efficacy and safety in Asian patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in period, 222 patients were randomised to receive either amlodipine (5 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 10 mg daily, n=109) or nifedipine GITS (30 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 60 mg daily; n=113) for 12 weeks. A placebo was then substituted for further 2 days with continuous ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The increases in the last 9 h of mean ambulatory BP on day 2 after treatment withdrawal were significantly less with amlodipine than with nifedipine GITS: 4.4+/-7.0 vs 11.2+/-11.3 mmHg for systolic BP (P 140/90mm Hg). The study had an open-label design with no placebo control. After each period, clinic and ambulatory blood pressures were measured. Trough-to-peak (T/P) ratio was computed by dividing the blood pressure (BP) change at trough (22 to 24 hours after drug intake) by the change at peak (2 adjacent hours with a maximal BP reduction between the second and eighth hour after drug intake). SI was calculated as the ratio between the average of the 24, hourly, treatment-induced BP changes and its standard deviation.\\ After the initial 2-week treatment period, clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BP values were higher in non-responders (145 +/- 11/87 +/- 8 and 135 +/- 17/80 +/- 6mm Hg, respectively) than in responders (133 +/- 6/81 +/- 3 and 130 +/- 9/77 +/- 7mm Hg). In non-responders, clinic and 24-hour BP values were lowered after a further 2 weeks of treatment with ER felodipine 10 mg/day (128 +/- 11/78 +/- 6 and 128 +/- 12/75 +/- 5mm Hg). SI was high in responders (0.8 +/- 0.8/0.7 +/- 0.7 for systolic/diastolic BP) and low in non-responders (0.5 +/- 0.6/0.3 +/- 0.6) during the first 2-week treatment period. It increased in non-responders after an additional 2 weeks of treatment with ER felodipine 10 mg/day (1.0 +/- 0.8/0.7 +/- 0.6). Median T/P ratios were 0.73 and 0.61 (systolic BP and diastolic BP) in responders and 0.41 and 0.61 in non-responders after 2 weeks of treatment. At variance with SI, T/P ratios did not increase in non-responders after doubling the dosage of ER felodipine (0.34 and 0.18). ER felodipine did not increase 24-hour heart rate. A total of nine adverse events were recorded in six patients (17%), but no patients withdrew from the study.\\ ER felodipine 5 to 10 mg/day smoothly and safely reduces 24-hour ambulatory BP in elderly patients with hypertension.}

The response rate to treatment and the changes of sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) at week 12 were similar between the two groups. A lower sitting systolic BP (SBP) was detected with amlodipine at week 4 (p < 0.05) and at week 8 (p < 0.05). Standing BP showed no changes between the two groups; only SBP was lower with amlodipine at week 8 (p < 0.05). Heart rate was lower at all treatment visits with nebivolol (p < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was no different between the two groups; however the incidence of headache and ankle oedema was significantly higher with amlodipine (p < 0.05). In elderly subjects with essential hypertension, the antihypertensive efficacy of nebivolol and amlodipine was similar. Both drugs were well tolerated, although amlodipine was accompanied by higher incidence of drug-related adverse events.}

Participants were randomized to a goal mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of either 102 to 107 mm Hg (usual MAP goal) or 92 mm Hg or less (low MAP goal). Participants in each of these groups were also randomized (double-blind) to a regimen containing metoprolol succinate, ramipril, or amlodipine besylate. Additional agents were added, if required, in the following recommended order: furosemide, doxazosin mesylate, clonidine hydrochloride, or hydralazine hydrochloride (or minoxidil, if needed).\\ In participants randomized to the low MAP goal, the percentage of participants who achieved a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg increased from a baseline of 20.0% to 78.9% by 14 months after randomization. For usual MAP goal participants, the corresponding percentages increased from 21.5% to 41.8%. The difference in median levels of MAP between the 2 MAP goal groups increased and remained at approximately 12 mm Hg. Blood pressure reduction was similar regardless of age, sex, body mass index, education, insurance or employment status, income, or marital status.\\ The blood pressure goals set and achieved in AASK participants clearly demonstrate that adequate blood pressure control can be achieved even in hypertensive populations whose blood pressure is the most difficult to control.}

Patients were divided into those with target organ damage (TOD; n=107) and those free of end-organ damage.

In 53 patients, variables were further measured after 6 months of intensified cardiovascular risk management. Patients with TOD had significantly higher vWF, 137 (SD 33) versus 125 (SD 33) IU/dL (P=0.002,) and a greater proportion of smokers, 31% versus 16% (P=0.002). There were no statistically significant differences in plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count, or sP-sel between the 2 subgroups. In multivariate analysis, vWF was a significant independent predictor for TOD. After 6 months of intensified management in 53 patients who entered the trial, there were significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, hematocrit, plasma viscosity, sP-sel, and vWF (all P<0.01) but no significant change in fibrinogen. In conclusion, there is a relationship between TOD and endothelial damage/dysfunction in hypertension. Intensified management results in improvements in hemorheology, endothelial and platelet function.}

Overall BP significantly decreased from 161.6 +/- 18.7/83.6 +/- 10.2 mmHg to 137.2 +/- 15.7/70.9 +/- 8.3 mmHg (p < 0.0005). Values, by treatment, were: For VT, 164.3 +/- 18.5/87.2 +/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline and 135.0 +/- 15.1/71.3 +/- 8.4 mmHg at conclusion. For LH, 158.8 +/- 17.4/80.1 +/- 8.4 mmHg at baseline and 139.3 +/- 16.1/70.5 +/- 8.2 mmHg at conclusion. Albuminuria significantly decreased from 308.2 +/- 544.7 mg/day to 198.0 +/- 285.3 mg/day. Both parameters showed no significant difference between treatments. Glycated hemoglobin decreased from 7.59 +/- 1.3% to 7.14 +/- 1.2% in the VT group, and from 7.96 +/- 1.29% to 7.84 +/- 1.62% in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.022). Changes adjusted from baseline values showed a trend to the difference between both treatments (p = 0.092). Plasmatic urea increased from 39.8 +/- 12.7 to 40.5 +/- 11.1 mg/dL in the TV group and from 43.4 +/- 12.0 mg/dL to 52.4 +/- 19.4 mg/dL in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.028). In conclusion, both treatments reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in a similar way in type II diabetic patients. The verapamil/trandolapril combination contributes to a better carbohydrate metabolism than losartan/hydroclorothiazide.}

   Abstract={Monotherapy frequently does not cause adequate blood pressure (BP) reduction and goal BP is not achieved. This double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study investigated, using a factorial design, the interaction between a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking drug (felodipine 5 mg) and an angiotensin type I receptor blocking drug (candesartan 16 mg) on the control of BP as assessed by 24-h ambulatory monitoring. A total of 31 elderly patients with systolic hypertension completed all four arms of the study. Candesartan and felodipine lowered mean 24-h BP to a similar extent (candesartan 12.2 +/- 2.6/7.5 +/- 1.8; felodipine 11.9 +/- 2.2/5.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg). The combination lowered it by 21.0 +/- 2.1/11.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, and this fall was significantly greater than with either of the monotherapies (P < .005) and was fully additive with no interactive term. The responder rate with the combination (90%) was greater than with candesartan (61%) or felodipine (55%). Microalbuminuria or proteinuria was present in 12 of 31 patients at randomization despite previous BP control. Candesartan and the combination both reduced urinary albumin excretion. Albumin excretion was not reduced by felodipine despite BP control similar to that achieved with candesartan. Side effects were infrequent and were fewer on the combination than on placebo or on the monotherapies. The combination of felodipine 5 mg and candesartan 16 mg has additive effects on BP in elderly patients with systolic hypertension. The combination was well tolerated and is suitable for use in patients who do not have an adequate response to monotherapy.}

   Abstract={Hypertension guidelines recommend initial treatment with a beta-blocker or diuretic and adding the other drug where blood pressure is not controlled. We hypothesized that systematic rotation through the major classes of antihypertensive drugs would demonstrate substantial differences in the pattern of an individual patient's response, and suggest a more rational approach to choosing best treatment.\\ Thirty-four young hypertensives (age 28-55, median 47) rotated in a double-blind, Latin-square, crossover fashion through 6 weeks of treatment each with amlodipine, doxazosin, lisinopril, bisoprolol, bendrofluazide and placebo. Blood pressure was measured at each visit. 'Best' drug, defined by efficacy and tolerability, was repeated at the end.\\ Rotation doubled the number of patients reaching target blood pressure (systolic < 140 mmHg) on one drug (P = 0.03). All five drugs were represented among the 'best' drugs. In six patients, the blood pressure on 'best' drug was at least 10 mmHg lower than on any other. Response to the 'best' drug was highly correlated (r = 0.79) with its previous administration. By contrast, there were only weak correlations between responses to pairs of drugs, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (A) with beta-blocker (B), and calcium blocker (C) with diuretic (D) - each r = 0.71, P < 0.005). In these young patients, the majority of patients (23/34) responded best to a drug suppressing the renin system (A and B).\\ Patients vary reproducibly in their response to initial treatment, and switching among drugs can increase the efficacy of monotherapy. The results support an AB/CD scheme for choosing therapy, in which the first drug is taken from one of these pairs, and uncontrolled patients switch to one of the other pair.}

   Abstract={Repigmentation of grey hair is rare, but has been described in several clinical settings. It has most often been reported as a postinflammatory effect, but several drugs, chronic arsenic exposure and coeliac disease have also been cited in addition to darkening as a spontaneous phenomenon. We report two patients with sustained repigmentation of the hair in association with porphyria cutanea tarda. The mechanism for this repigmentation remains elusive, but presumably involves recruitment of outer root sheath melanocytes, which are then activated to form functional hair bulb melanocytes.}

   Abstract={The objective of the study was to assess the factors related to the occurrence of microalbuminuria during the follow-up of a young adult group with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated. Normo-albuminuric essential hypertensives, <50 years old, who had not been previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and who did not have diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological measures (n=62), beta-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8), and several classes (n=15). Measurements were taken for office blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at the beginning of the study and were measured yearly during an average of 2.7+/-1.2 years of follow-up. Among the 187 patients included, 22 (11,7%) developed microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/y). No differences were present between progressors and those who remained normo-albuminuric (nonprogressors) in terms of age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, familial history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking habits, or the presence of EKG left ventricular hypertrophy. The group with the lowest progression rate was the patients treated with ACE inhibitors (n=5; 2.9/100 patients/y), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/y) and the beta-blockers group (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/y). When we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or those who changed over time between different classes of treatment, no significant differences in the incidence of microalbuminuria were observed among the groups. Progressors showed higher slopes of fasting glucose (4.78+/-11.4 versus 0.50+/-6.8 mg/y, P<0.02) and uric acid (0.58+/-0.93 versus 0.05+/-1.10 mg/y, P<0.03) compared with the slopes of nonprogressors. Both the slopes for glucose and systolic blood pressure over time were associated independently with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, gender, and treatment groups. Cox proportional hazard model for progression of microalbuminuria showed that baseline urinary albumin excretion (risk ratio [RR]=1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to 1.11), slope for systolic blood pressure (RR=1.11; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.20), and slope for glucose (RR=1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were independently associated to the development of microalbuminuria. In conclusion, in a group of young adults with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated, the main factors influencing the occurrence of microalbuminuria during antihypertensive treatment were the values of microalbuminuria at baseline and the slopes for systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose.}

   Abstract={The aim of this study was to measure the time-effect profiles of a once-daily administered valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and amlodipine on blood pressure using various indices derived from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring.\\ Of the 310 randomized outpatients with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate primary hypertension, 259 (133 on valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 126 on amlodipine) were eligible for analysis. After a 2-week placebo wash-out period, the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either valsartan 80 mg once daily (o.d.) or amlodipine 5 mg o.d. for 4 weeks; in the case of an unsatisfactory blood pressure response, the treatments could be respectively changed to the fixed combination of valsartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg o.d. or amlodipine 10 mg o.d. for a further 8 weeks. The trough:peak ratio (global and individualized approaches) and smoothness index (i.e., the ratio between the average of the 24-hourly BP changes after treatment and the corresponding standard deviation) were calculated from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings made after the placebo period and after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of active treatment.\\ Both regimens effectively lowered systolic and diastolic ambulatory pressures after 4 weeks and 12 weeks (all P<0.001) but, among the responders, the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination had a greater antihypertensive effect during the night-time hours after 12 weeks (P=0.03/0.02). In the responders, the placebo-adjusted, mean trough:peak ratios were 0.76/0.74 in the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 111) and 0.66/0.62 in the amlodipine group (n = 101). The corresponding global trough:peak ratios were 0.61/0.57 for the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and 0.56/0.56 for amlodipine. However, the between-group differences in individual or global trough:peak ratios were not significant. The smoothness index was slightly, but insignificantly, greater for valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide than for amlodipine in the responders and the groups as a whole.\\ Valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine were equally effective in reducing ambulatory BP, but the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination led to more homogeneous BP control during the inter-dosing interval. Trough:peak ratio and smoothness index did not reflect this finding accurately.}

   Abstract={In a previous retrospective study, long-term treatment of essential hypertensive patients with a slow-release calcium channel blocker resulted in normal resistance artery structure and endothelial function, which did not occur with a beta-blocker. In the present prospective study, 19 previously untreated essential hypertensive patients (aged 47 +/- 2 years, 75% male) were treated for 1 year in a double-blind randomized study with the long-acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the beta-blocker atenolol. Resistance arteries (lumen diameter, 150 to 350 microm) dissected from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies were studied on a pressurized myograph. Blood pressure (BP) control (129 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) was identical in both groups for the last 6 months of the study. After 1 year of treatment with amlodipine, the media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) of resistance arteries decreased from 7.89% +/- 0.40% to 6.81% +/- 0.41% (P < .05). Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation tended to improve from 84.3% +/- 5.5% to 90.5% +/- 4.8% (P = .06), whereas sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was unchanged in the patients treated with amlodipine. In the beta-blocker-treated group there was no significant change in M/L or acetylcholine-induced relaxation. In conclusion, treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine corrected altered resistance artery structure and tended to improve endothelial function in essential hypertensive patients, whereas similar good control of BP with the beta-blocker atenolol did not. Whether the vascular protective effect of amlodipine will result in improved outcomes in hypertension remains to be demonstrated.}

   Abstract={In a single-center study, we compared to what extent changes in conventional and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) predicted regression of left ventricular mass (LVM) index in response to antihypertensive treatment in previously untreated and treated patients with sustained hypertension.\\ We enrolled 173 black African patients who, off treatment, had a daytime diastolic BP ranging from 90 to 114 mm Hg. Antihypertensive drugs were titrated and combined to reduce the daytime diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg. Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and follow-up. Mean systolic/diastolic clinic BP, 24-hour BP, and LVM index were similar in previously untreated (n=64) and previously treated (n=109) patients and averaged 171/102 mm Hg, 151/97 mm Hg, and 118 g/m2, respectively. At 4 months, these values had decreased (P<0.001) by 26/12 mm Hg, 23/14 mm Hg, and 14 g/m2 in previously untreated patients and by 22/9 mm Hg, 21/13 mm Hg, and 19 g/m2 in previously treated patients. In the previously untreated patients, the regression in LVM index correlated to a similar degree (P=0.09) with the decreases in the conventional (r=0.34; P=0.005) and the 24-hour (r=0.26; P=0.04) systolic BP. In the previously treated patients, the corresponding correlations were 0.02 (P=0.82) and -0.10 (P=0.32), respectively. Compared with the 24-hour systolic BP, automated oscillometric measurements of systolic BP obtained at the clinic yielded similar results.\\ In previously untreated patients with sustained hypertension followed at a single center, reductions in clinic and ambulatory systolic pressure in response to antihypertensive treatment equally predicted the regression in LVM index.}

   Abstract={Sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems play important roles in essential hypertension. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of losartan or its combination with quinapril on the cardiac nervous system and neurohormonal status in essential hypertension.\\ Randomized, comparative study of 105 patients with mild essential hypertension, carried out at Shizuoka General Hospital. In phase 1, 40 hypertensives were allocated randomly into the losartan (50 mg) group or the quinapril (10 mg) group. In phase 2, 65 hypertensives, after 3 months 10 mg quinapril monotherapy, were allocated randomly into groups with 50 mg losartan (n = 32) or 5 mg amlodipine (n = 33) added to quinapril, and were treated for a further 3 months. All patients underwent [(123)I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging and neurohormonal measurements before and 3 months after treatment.\\ Both monotherapies significantly increased renin activity, while losartan monotherapy also increased angiotensin II (AII) concentration. In both the losartan and quinapril groups, the washout rate was significantly decreased (18.1 +/- 11.4 versus 13.9 +/- 11.0%, P < 0.0002 and 13.3 +/- 9.3 versus 12.3 +/- 9.1%, P < 00001, respectively) without changes in the heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M ratio). Both combined therapies lowered blood pressure to similar levels. A combination therapy with losartan and quinapril significantly increased the H/M ratio (1.93 +/- 0.29 and 2.02 +/- 0.29, P < 0.01) and decreased the washout rate (17.6 +/- 11.0 and 15.3 +/- 9.2%, P < 0.02) without affecting AII concentration, whereas a combination therapy with amlodipine and quinapril therapy did not affect the scintigraphic parameters with an increase in the AII concentration.\\ With a usual antihypertensive dose, both losartan and quinapril had a little suppressive effect on the cardiac sympathetic activity in essential hypertension. In contrast, the combination therapy with losartan and quinapril, which results in a higher degree of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, could suppress the cardiac sympathetic activity effectively.}

   Abstract={The objective of this study was to compare, at equal blood pressure (BP) reduction, the effect of two different combinations on metabolic control and albuminuria in type 2 diabetic hypertensive patients with albuminuria. This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial carried out in 11 Spanish hospitals. A total of 103 type 2 diabetic patients with stable albuminuria and BP not controlled on monotherapy were randomised of which 93 finished the study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo period, patients were randomised to verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg (VT) or to enalapril/hydroclorothiazide 20/12.5 mg (EH). Treatment duration was 6 months. The main outcome measures were changes in BP, 24-h albuminuria, blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin. Overall BP was significantly reduced from 157.3 +/- 12.0/98.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 140.5 +/- 14.5/86.1 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and albuminuria significantly decreased from 508.6 +/- 693.8 mg/24 h to 253.4 +/- 517.2 mg/24 h (P < 0.001), both without significant differences between treatments. Glycated haemoglobin was not modified on VT: baseline, 5.91 +/- 1.43%; end of treatment, 5.94 +/- 1.62%, but increased on EH: baseline, 5.96 +/- 1.25%; final, 6.41 +/- 1.51%, (ANOVA interaction P = 0.040). At the end of the study, a blood glucose <126 mg/dL was attained in 72.7% of the VT group-improving in 29.5% and worsening in 6.8% of patients (P = 0.021)-and in 50% of the EH group, 13.6% of patients improved and 11.4% worsened (P = 1.000). There were no changes in body weight, serum creatinine, uric acid, potassium, cholesterol, tryglicerides and serum albumin. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients not controlled on monotherapy, both treatments similarly reduced albuminuria. The combination verapamil/ trandolapril seems to allow a better metabolic control than enalapril/hydroclorothiazide.}

Patients then were switched to nisoldipine 10 mg/day (> or = 65 yrs old) or 20 mg/day (< 65 yrs old) and returned to the clinic at 2-week intervals to assess cuff blood pressure, heart rate, adverse effects, and compliance. No adverse effects were experienced in 15 of the 25 patients. Lower extremity edema was the most commonly reported adverse effect (four patients). Two patients discontinued treatment because of pulmonary edema in one and chest pain in the other. Two patients were lost to follow-up. After a mean of 10.6 weeks, repeat 24-hour ambulatory monitoring was performed to evaluate blood pressure control with nisoldipine. Systolic and diastolic ambulatory results for daytime, nighttime, and total 24 hours were calculated. For amlodipine versus nisoldipine, no significant differences existed in any of the blood pressure parameters (p>0.05) in the 21 patients who completed the study, except for 24-hour diastolic pressure (p<0.05); however, this latter difference was only 2 mm Hg (nisoldipine 77 mm Hg, amlodipine 75 mm Hg).\\ Both amlodipine and nisoldipine have similar 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure profiles. The frequency of lower extremity edema was no different after the switch to nisoldipine than when the patients were taking amlodipine.}

Between the 2 visits, HG showed significant reductions for P (p<0.01), L (p<0.045) and H (p<0.033); and the NG for L (p<0.0001). Lymphocytes showed differences in the NG with respect to the B lymphocytes (p<0.008).\\ Nifedipine affects the inflammatory infiltrate with a greater number of lymphocytes (especially B) and these cells fell significantly in number after periodontal treatment.}

The rate of responders to treatment at the end of fourth week (before up-titration) was 57.4% among the valsartan-treated patients and 61.9% among the amlodipine-treated patients (ns). At the end of the study, the rate of responders was not significantly different between the two groups (74.9 versus 72.1%). Valsartan-based treatment had a slightly lower incidence of adverse events (1.5 versus 5.5%; P = 0.006).\\ The results of this trial demonstrate that the valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and amlodipine are equally effective in lowering BP, and that the combination is better tolerated.}

One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.\\ on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.\\ phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.}

In total 320 patients aged 18 - 75 years, with mean sitting diastolic blood pressures of 95 - 115 mmHg, were randomized to treatment with imidapril (n = 157) or nifedipine SR (n = 163). Efficacy evaluations were based on the intent-to-treat principle. On study completion, there was no difference between the groups with respect to the primary efficacy variable of response to treatment (imidapril 63.1%; nifedipine SR 61.3%). After 2 weeks' treatment, clinically relevant decreases in blood pressure were observed in both groups, with a trend towards further reductions until study end. Fewer patients in the imidapril-treated group than the nifedipine group withdrew due to adverse events that occurred on treatment with study medication (3.2% versus 16.0%) or experienced adverse events (40.1% versus 49.7%). In addition, fewer adverse events were causally related to imidapril (24.2%) compared with nifedipine SR (41.7%). These results show that imidapril is effective in the treatment of essential hypertension and is better tolerated than nifedipine SR.}

   Abstract={Calcium controls numerous events within the vessel wall. Permeability of the endothelium is calcium dependent, as are platelet activation and adhesion, vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration, and synthesis of fibrous connective tissue. Double-helix computerized tomography is a noninvasive technique that can detect, measure, and compare coronary calcification in the coronary arteries. Using this method, our objective was to determine whether administration of nifedipine once daily in lieu of diuretics in high-risk hypertensive patients will arrest or slow down the progression of coronary artery calcification. The study was designed as a side arm of INSIGHT (International Nifedipine Study: Intervention as Goal for Hypertension Therapy), aimed to show the efficacy of nifedipine once daily versus co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, amiloride 2.5 mg) in high-risk hypertensive patients. A total of 201 patients with a total calcium score of >/=10 at the onset of study who underwent an annual double-helix computerized tomography for 3 years were analyzed for efficacy. Inhibition of coronary calcium progression was significant in the nifedipine versus the co-amilozide group during the first year (3.18% versus 27%, respectively, P=0.02), not significant during the second year (28.5% versus 47%, respectively, P=0.14), and significant during the third year (40% versus 78%, respectively, P=0.02). The results point to a slower progression of coronary calcification in hypertensive patients on nifedipine once daily versus co-amilozide.}

   Abstract={Gingival enlargement is a known side effect of nifedipine use. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors for gingival enlargement in nifedipine-treated patients.\\ A cross-sectional study was conducted in a primary care center. Data from 65 patients taking nifedipine were compared with 147 controls who had never received the drug. All patients were examined for the presence of gingival enlargement using 2 different indices: vertical gingival overgrowth index (GO) in 6 points around each tooth, and horizontal MB index in the interdental area. Gingival index, plaque index, and probing depth were also evaluated.\\ The prevalence of gingival enlargement was significantly higher in nifedipine-treated cases than in controls (GO index, 33.8% versus 4.1%; MB index, 50.8% versus 7.5%, respectively). Higher gingival and plaque indices were observed in patients taking nifedipine. Among the possible risk factors, only the gingival index showed a significant association with gingival enlargement. The risk (odds ratio [OR]) of gingival enlargement associated with nifedipine therapy was 10.6 (3.8-29.1) for the GO index and 14.4 (6-34.6) for the MB index. Gingival index-adjusted ORs were 9.6 (3.3-28.1) and 9.7 (3.9-23.3), respectively. In the subset of high nifedipine exposure patients, the odds ratio for gingival enlargement increased to 17.4 (5.3-56.3) for the GO index and 23.6 (7.7-72.3) for the MB index. The concordance between GO and MB indices showed a kappa value of 0.689 in controls and 0.642 in patients treated with nifedipine.\\ Patients taking nifedipine are at high risk for gingival enlargement, and gingivitis acts as a predisposing factor.}

   Abstract={A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial showed 14 of 18 (78%) of the elderly hypertensive men in this study had an uncomplicated and beneficial response to either fosinopril or verapamil. There was a well-tolerated reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DRP). There were no significant adverse drug events. Only the sitting SBP and the sitting DBP were significantly lowered by fosinopril and verapamil SR. Because reduction in both SBP and DBP in elderly hypertensives has been shown to be beneficial, these findings take on further importance when considering the choice of medication for antihypertensive therapy in the elderly. The increase in norepinephrine in the fosinopril-treated patients may explain why patients treated with long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in combination with diuretics rarely complain of orthostatic symptoms.}

   Volume="14",
   Number="3",
   Pages="237--241",
   Abstract={Nifedipine and nimodipine, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, are commonly used as antihypertensive and antianginal agents in patients at risk for stroke. At least one stroke trial suggests that patients receiving calcium channel blockers at the time of an acute stroke have worse outcomes than those receiving other or no antihypertensive medications. We hypothesize that the poor outcome may not be related to blood pressure changes but instead may be mediated by competitive inhibition of important enzymes of pyrimidine synthesis whose products are needed to repair nerve cell membranes after an acute stroke. Both drugs acted as competitive inhibitors of the only enzymes that are known to synthesize the nucleotide uridine-5'-phosphate: uridine kinase and orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. Nifedipine produced Ki values of 28 microM for uridine kinase and 105 microM for orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. Nimodipine produced Ki values of 20 microM for uridine kinase and 18 microM for orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. For uridine kinase, these inhibitors bound more tightly than the physiologic substrates uridine or cytidine. For the decarboxylase, the inhibitors bound less tightly than the normal physiologic substrate orotidine-5'-phosphate. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether the concentrations of nifedipine or nimodipine, and of cytidine, uridine, and orotidine-5'-phosphate in human brain, are such that this inhibition would affect stroke outcome.}

   Abstract={The effects of disease states and therapeutic drugs on the QT interval have been extensively studied in an attempt to understand the relationship between QT and the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. Differences in heart rate correction methods, electrocardiogram lead placement, and other internal (eg, genetic, physiologic) and external (eg, food, time of day) factors have confounded the interpretation of this relationship. A comprehensive review of the epidemiologic literature suggests that the corrected QT interval (QTc) is an important but imprecise marker of cardiovascular disease. The association between QTc prolongation and mortality has been identified in patients with cardiac disease but is unclear in patients without cardiac disease. Drug-related prolongation of QTc can clearly increase the risk of torsade de pointes, but this arrhythmia is rarely associated with a QTc of less than 500 ms. It also appears that noncardiac drugs that are associated with QTc prolongation are not identical in their proarrhythmic capacities and that increased exposure via clinically significant drug interactions is a major contributor to the liability of noncardiac drug-induced arrhythmia. Recognition of the aforementioned variables in conjunction with careful QTc measurements assists in establishing a more precise benefit-risk ratio for a specific drug therapy or for arrhythmia risk associated with various pathophysiologic or genetic states.}

Following a 4- to 5-week placebo run-in period, patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 90 to 99 mm Hg received candesartan cilexetil 16 mg (n = 123) or amlodipine 5 mg (n = 128) once daily. After 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients were uptitrated to candesartan cilexetil 32 mg or amlodipine 10 mg once daily. There were no significant differences between the candesartan cilexetil and amlodipine regimens for reducing BP; mean systolic BP/diastolic BP reductions were -15.2/-10.2 mm Hg versus -15.4/-11.3 mm Hg, respectively (p = 0.88/0.25). Overall, 79% of patients on candesartan cilexetil and 87% of those on amlodipine were controlled (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg). A total of 3.3% of patients on candesartan cilexetil discontinued treatment, compared with 9.4% of patients on amlodipine, including 2.4% versus 4.7% for adverse events and 0% versus 1.6% for peripheral edema, respectively. Peripheral edema, the prespecified primary tolerability end point, occurred with significantly greater frequency in patients on amlodipine (22.1%; mild 8.7%, moderate 11.8%, severe 1.6%) versus patients on candesartan cilexetil (8.9%; mild 8.1%, moderate 0.8%) (p = 0.005). Candesartan cilexetil and amlodipine are both highly effective in controlling BP in patients with mild hypertension. Candesartan cilexetil offers a significant tolerability advantage with respect to less risk of developing peripheral edema.}

   Abstract={L-type dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been implicated in increased cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension, perhaps due to adverse effects on autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Blockade of T-type calcium channels may limit ANS dysfunction by inhibition of T channel-mediated neuroendocrine effects.\\ This double-blind, parallel group study compared the effect of nifedipine gastrointestinal transport system (GITS) (L-type CCB) versus mibefradil (T-type CCB) on ANS function in patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension.\\ Sixteen patients (10 male, 6 female; age 57.2 +/- 2.3 years), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 95 mmHg were randomized to nifedipine 30 mg daily or mibefradil 50 mg daily (2 weeks), then nifedipine 60 mg daily or mibefradil 100 mg daily (4 weeks). Sympathetic nervous system activity (SNSA) was assessed using norepinephrine kinetics. Parasympathetic nervous system activity (PSNA) was assessed from 24 h Holter recordings of heart rate variability (HRV). Non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) provided integrated assessment of ANS.\\ Patient groups were well matched at baseline. Achieved DBP was lower in patients treated with mibefradil compared with nifedipine, (83.4 +/- 1.7 versus 95.25 +/- 3.3 mmHg). There were no significant differences in SNSA and BRS between groups, however the root mean square of successive differences and high frequency power (HFP) were increased in mibefradil compared with nifedipine-treated patients [(+ 1.07 +/- 1.6 versus -3.36 +/- 1.2 ms, P < 0.05) and (+ 0.28 +/- 0.1 versus -0.23 +/- 0.1 ms2, P < 0.01), respectively]. Furthermore, Ln HFP/Ln total power was increased from week 0 to week 6 in the mibefradil-treated group, (0.71 +/- 0.02 versus 0.74 +/- 0.03, P = 0.046).\\ No differences existed between effect of L- and T-type CCBs on SNSA and BRS. However, T-type CCBs increased PSNA, independent of achieved changes in heart rate.}

Outcomes assessed at one, three, six, and 12 months included exercise duration and quality of life.\\ Exercise duration significantly improved from baseline in both groups. There was no difference in outcome between the groups (Med +40% v HBA +20%, p = NS). The heart rate profile on exercise was similarly slowed in both groups compared to baseline. Quality of life significantly improved in both treatment arms for the modified Karolinska questionnaire (KQ) (Med +50% v HBA +50%, p = NS) and the Nottingham health profile (NHP) (Med +40% v HBA +20%, p = NS). However, for the individual symptom scores of each questionnaire more were improved in the Med group (KQ-Med 6 improved v HBA 4, NHP-Med 3 v HBA 1). Left ventricular function was equally preserved by both treatments during follow up.\\ In these patients control of ventricular response rate with either HBA + VVIR pacemaker or atrioventricular modifying drugs + VVI pacemaker will lead to a significant improvement in exercise duration and quality of life. Rhythm regulation by HBA did not confer additional benefit, suggesting rate control alone is necessary for the successful symptomatic treatment of these patients in permanent AF.}

   Abstract={Calcium antagonists have long been used as first-line drugs for hypertension and angina. However, deleterious effects have also been reported in patients treated with calcium antagonists. Thus, we evaluated the effect of a slow-release twice-daily formulation of nifedipine in 10 patients with severe coronary artery disease. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) and blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were performed simultaneously to detect any association between ischemic episodes on the ECG and changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate with and without nifedipine. Increased oxygen demand due to an increased systolic BP and heart rate was associated with ischemic episodes without nifedipine, while those with nifedipine were accompanied by a fall in diastolic BP and a rapid increase in heart rate. This slow-release twice-daily formulation of nifedipine may induce myocardial ischemia through a heart-rate increase and a decrease in coronary blood flow due to lower diastolic BP in patients with severe coronary artery disease. A once-daily formulation of nifedipine might be of great value for such patients.}

   Abstract={Cognitive impairment occurs more frequently in hypertensives than in normotensive individuals. Early signs of cognitive impairment are predictors of dementia in late life. Felodipine is capable of almost normalizing plasma viscosity, which is elevated in most of hypertensive patients, thus improving microcirculation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this hemorheologic property of felodipine in addition to its blood pressure lowering effect can improve cognitive performance in hypertensive patients.\\ Randomized, double-blind comparison between felodipine 10 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg amiloride 5 mg (HCT/amiloride) in patients 50-70 years of age with impaired cognitive function (c.l. test 1-2 points) and with resting blood pressure values of diastolic > 95 and < or = 115 mmHg and/or systolic > 160 and < or = 210 mmHg. Blood pressure measurements and evaluation of total short term storage capacity were done at the beginning and after 12 weeks of treatment.\\ 31 patients (14 felodipine and 17 HCT/amiloride) were included in the per protocol analysis. Blood pressure values at the beginning and after 12 weeks of treatment were (mmHg): for felodipine systolic 168 +/- 4 and 150 +/- 6 (p < 0.01), diastolic 108 +/- 3 and 88 +/- 4 (p < 0.001). For amiloride/HCT systolic 173 +/- 8 and 150 +/- 10 (p < 0.01), diastolic 105 +/- 5 and 88 +/- 5 (p < 0.001). Short term storage capacity improved by 15 +/- 6 bits during felodipine treatment (p < 0.001) and by 9 +/- 9 bits during amiloride/HCT treatment (p < 0.05). Thus cognitive improvement was superior by 67% in the felodipine group compared to amiloride/HCT (p < 0.05).\\ In this study a pronounced improvement of mental performance occurred in patients treated with felodipine. Since the cognitive gain was significantly superior to amiloride/HCT treatment there must be an additional blood pressure-independent effect of felodipine, such as enhancing microcirculation. Whether these properties possibly counteract the development of dementia in hypertensives has to be evaluated in long term studies in more patients.}

   Abstract={Atrial fibrillation remains a frequent complication after heart surgery. The optimal strategy to treat the condition has not been established. Several retrospective studies have suggested that a primary rate-control strategy may be equivalent to a strategy that restores sinus rhythm.\\ Fifty patients with atrial fibrillation after heart surgery were randomly assigned to a strategy of antiarrhythmic therapy with or without electrical cardioversion or ventricular rate control. Both arms received anticoagulation with heparin overlapped with warfarin. The primary end point was time to conversion to sinus rhythm analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Atrial fibrillation relapse after the initial conversion was monitored in the hospital over a 2-month period.\\ There was no significant difference between an antiarrhythmic conversion strategy (n = 27) and a rate-control strategy (n = 23) in time to conversion to sinus rhythm (11.2 +/- 3. 2 vs 11.8 +/- 3.9 hours; P =.8). With the use of Cox multivariate analysis to control for the effects of age, sex, beta-blocker usage, and type of surgery, the antiarrhythmic strategy showed a trend toward reducing the time from treatment to restoration of sinus rhythm (P =.08). The length of hospital stay was reduced in the antiarrhythmic arm compared with the rate-control strategy (9.0 +/- 0.7 vs 13.2 +/- 2.0 days; P =.05). In-hospital relapse rates in the antiarrhythmic arm were 30% compared with 57% in the rate-control strategy (P =.24). There were no significant difference in relapse rates at 1 week (24% vs 28%), 4 weeks (6% vs 12%), and 6 to 8 weeks (4% vs 9%). At the end of the study, 91% of the patients in the rate-control arm were in sinus rhythm compared with 96% in the antiarrhythmic arm (P =.6).\\ This pilot study shows little difference between a rate-control strategy and a strategy to restore sinus rhythm. Regardless of strategy, most patients will be in sinus rhythm after 2 months. A larger randomized, controlled study is needed to assess the impact of restoration of sinus rhythm on length of stay.}

   Abstract={To compare the effects of rilmenidine with those of amlodipine on blood pressure, glucose metabolism, plasma lipid concentration and fibrinolysis parameters.\\ A four-month randomized double-blind, parallel group study.\\ Obese hypertensive patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (> or = 2.3 mmol/l) and impaired glucose tolerance (OMS-ADA) were included (n = 52). A placebo run-in period of 2 weeks was followed by 4 months of double-blind treatment with either rilmenidine or amlodipine. Blood pressure was recorded using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral glucose tolerance test\\ Of the 52 patients recruited, 47 (21 rilmenidine and 26 amlodipine) completed the 4-month treatment period. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) with the two anti-hypertensive treatments (rilmenidine -13.9/-13.5 mmHg; amlodipine - 17.6/-15.0 mmHg). Insulin concentrations under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load did not change significantly after treatment in both groups. Plasma glucose under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral glucose load as well as the area under the plasma glucose concentration curve tended to decrease in the rilmenidine group and to increase in the amlodipine group so that the changes in these parameters were significantly different between the two study groups (P= 0.041, P = 0.042 and P = 0.015, respectively). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen and PAI-1 activity were only decreased in the rilmenidine group (not statistically significant).\\ Our results demonstrate that rilmenidine and amlodipine have a comparable anti-hypertensive effect but only rilmenidine is able to improve glucose metabolism.}

   Abstract={Around 40% of the elderly population suffer from arterial hypertension. An effective antihypertensive treatment is therefore required. Calcium antagonists are used to treat hypertension because, owing to their mechanism of action, they can provoke systemic, as well as coronary vasodilatation. In this study the authors aimed to evaluate the activity and tolerability of diltiazem compared to ramipril in a group of elderly patients suffering from essential arterial hypertension.\\ A controlled single-blind study was performed in which patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, A and B, consisting of 25 patients each, treated respectively with 300 mg sustained-release diltiazem or 5 mg ramipril in a single daily dose. The study lasted 6 months and evaluated systolic and diastolic pressure and heart rate.\\ The evolution was positive in all patients in Group A and most patients in Group B, with the normalisation of both systolic and diastolic values. Heart rate showed a more persistent fall in Group A, but this was expected owing to the mechanism of action of diltiazem. No patient in Group A had to suspend treatment, whereas one patient in Group B had to interrupt therapy following the onset of a persistent cough.\\ Both treatments resulted in similar changes in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. In the light of these results, it can be affirmed that, at an oral dose of 300 mg/day, sustained-release diltiazem was found to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension in the aged.}

   Abstract={The Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure has reported that combinations of low doses of antihypertensive agents from different classes may provide additional antihypertensive efficacy and minimize the likelihood of dose-dependent adverse effects. Doxazosin and amlodipine, alone and in combination, were compared for efficacy in reducing blood pressure (BP) in 75 patients with predominantly moderate (Stage 2) hypertension. This was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. After a 2-week washout period, patients in group A (n = 37) received amlodipine 10 mg and patients in group B (n = 38) received doxazosin 4 mg for 6 weeks. All patients then received reduced-dose combination therapy (amlodipine 5 mg and doxazosin 2 mg) for 6 weeks. Subsequently, patients received 6 weeks of monotherapy with the alternate medication (group A received doxazosin 4 mg and group B received amlodipine 10 mg). During both monotherapy periods, doxazosin and amlodipine significantly reduced systolic and diastolic BP (P < .001 v baseline). BP further decreased with combination therapy (P < .01 v monotherapy). The percentage of patients with Stage 2 hypertension who achieved a target BP of < 140/< 90 mm Hg increased from 78% with monotherapy to 94% with combination therapy. Fewer adverse effects were observed during combination therapy. It is concluded that there is an additional fall in blood pressure when reduced doses of doxazosin and amlodipine are used in combination for the treatment of hypertension, suggesting that doxazosin should be considered as an effective add-on treatment to calcium-channel blockers.}

Another objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of both combinations. One hundred hypertensives with systolic blood pressure 140-209 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 90-119 mm Hg were evaluated after 16 weeks receiving a fixed combination of verapamil SR 180 mg/ trandolapril 2 mg (VT) or captopril 50 mg/hydro- chlorothiazide 25 mg (CH) both given once daily. Lipids and lipoproteins were assessed in duplicate on 2 consecutive days. The study was completed by 80 patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the two combined regimens with respect to low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol for the 'intention-to-treat' population measured at the end of each treatment period (3.44 +/- 0.87 mmol/L with VT, and 3.46 +/- 0.86 mmol/L with CH). No differences were found for other lipid parameters like total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A1 and B, Lp(a). High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was significantly higher with VT (1.39 +/- 0.01 vs 1.35 +/- 0.01, P < 0. 03). Serum potassium declined while uric acid and glucose increased on CH. In conclusion, no significant differences were found in LDL-cholesterol and in other lipid parameters with the exception of HDL-cholesterol which was significantly higher on VT. Serum potassium declined while uric acid and glucose increased on CH (all significantly). Both fixed combinations were well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events was higher on CH. Both fixed combinations significantly lowered BP. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 347-354}

   Abstract={Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are well established and widely used as monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Earlier studies combining short acting drugs from these classes require multiple dosing and were associated with poor compliance. Availability of longer acting compounds allows once daily administration to avoid the inconvenience of a multiple daily dose. It was decided to perform a randomised double blind, crossover study with the long acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the long acting ACE inhibitor lisinopril, given either alone or in combination in essential hypertension. Twenty four patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 104 mm Hg received amlodipine 2.5 mg and 5 mg, lisinopril 5 mg and 10 mg, and their combination as per a prior randomisation schedule. Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at weekly intervals. Higher doses of both the drugs individually or in combination were used if the target supine DBP below 90 mm Hg was not achieved. There was a significant additional blood pressure lowering effect with the combination when compared either with amlodipine or lisinopril alone. Five mg amlodipine and 10 mg lisinopril monotherapy achieved the target blood pressure in 71% and 72% patients respectively. The combination of 2.5 mg amlodipine with 5 mg lisinopril produced a much more significant lowering of blood pressure in a higher percentage of patients than that with an individual low dose.}

Sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg OD was administered for 2 weeks, then optimally titrated, at 2 week intervals, to SR diltiazem 240 mg OD and then SR diltiazem 180 mg + ramipril 2.5 mg OD to achieve supine DBP < or = 90 mm Hg. After 4 weeks of diltiazem monotherapy (SR diltiazem 180 mg or 240 mg OD) mean supine DBP was reduced from 102.84 +/- 3.81 mm Hg to 90.15 +/- 5.02 mm Hg (P < 0.01) and mean supine heart rate was reduced from 85.15 +/- 11.02 bpm to 77.62 +/- 11.45 bpm (p < 0.01). Diltiazem monotherapy reduced supine DBP to < or = 90 mm Hg in 35/45 (77.77%) patients. Combination therapy (SR diltiazem 180 mg + ramipril 2.5 mg OD), received by non-responders to diltiazem monotherapy, reduced supine DBP to < or = 90 mm Hg in 3/10 (30%) patients. Sinus bradycardia was observed in one patient. Sustained-release diltiazem alone and in combination with ramipril reduce blood pressure in a dose related manner and is well tolerated.}

   Abstract={To investigate whether the choice of calcium channel blocker, used in conjunction with cyclosporin A, affected the prevalence of gingival overgrowth.\\ A cohort of 135 renal transplant recipients who had been medicated with cyclosporin A in combination with either nifedipine (89) or amlodipine (46) since transplant, took part in the study. The inclusion criteria were that eligible subjects had been in receipt of a kidney transplant for at least 12 months, had at least 10 teeth and had not received specialist periodontal treatment. The age, gender, current drug regimen and dosage were recorded for each participant and alginate impressions taken of both arches. The presence and severity of gingival overgrowth were scored from plaster models.\\ A higher proportion (72%) of the amlodipine group were categorised as having gingival overgrowth compared with only 53% of the nifedipine group, chi square=4.5, p<0.05. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between the presence or absence of gingival overgrowth (dependent variable) and age, gender, time since transplant, dose of cyclosporin A, centre in which the patient was treated, and the calcium channel blocker used (independent variables). Independent predictors of gingival overgrowth in this multivariate analysis were whether the individual was treated with amlodipine or nifedipine (p=0.01) and whether the individual was young or old (p=0.01). Within the multivariate analysis, the odds ratio for amlodipine to be associated with gingival overgrowth compared with nifedipine was 3.0 (confidence interval 1.3-6.9).\\ The prevalence of gingival overgrowth in renal transplant recipients maintained on cyclosporin A and nifedipine is lower than those treated with cyclosporin A and amlodipine.}

   Abstract={Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) blunt postural skin vasoconstriction, an autoregulatory mechanism that minimizes gravitational increases in capillary pressure and avoids fluid extravasation when standing. To evaluate the dose-response relation between this pharmacological interference and dependent edema, a frequent side effect of CCBs during antihypertensive treatment, skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) at the dorsum of the foot, both supine and with the limb passively placed 50 cm below the heart level, and leg weight (Archimedes principle) were measured at baseline, during increasing doses of the dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 and 10 mg UID each for 2 weeks), and after drug withdrawal in 10 hypertensive men. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may attenuate ankle swelling by CCBs, those parameters were evaluated according to a similar design during amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg UID) combined (n=10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients (n=8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight without modifying postural vasoconstriction (the percent skin blood flow decrease from horizontal to dependent position), which indicates that extravascular fluid shift was independent of postural skin vasoconstriction. At 10 mg UID, however, amlodipine blunted postural vasoconstriction and increased leg weight further, which suggests that skin blood flow autoregulation limited additional fluid transfer. Both parameters normalized after drug withdrawal. Enalapril per se did not affect cutaneous vasomotion or leg weight but reduced the amount of dependent fluid extravasation by the CCB despite a persistent antagonism for postural vasoconstrictor responses.}

Each patient received three drugs with a two-week washout period between treatments. The primary end point was the absolute difference in FMD after eight weeks of each study drug compared with their respective baselines analyzed in a blinded fashion.\\ There was mild impairment of FMD at baseline (7.3 +/- 0.6%). The change in FMD from baseline was significant only for quinapril (1.8 +/- 1%, p < 0.02). No change was seen with losartan (0.8 +/- 1.1%, p = 0.57), amlodipine (0.3 +/- 0.9%, p = 0.97) or enalapril (-0.2 +/- 0.8%, p = 0.84). No significant change in nitroglycerin-induced dilation occurred with drug therapy. The improvement in quinapril response was not seen in those with the DD ACE genotype (0.5 +/- 2.1%) but was seen in those with the ID and II genotype (3.3 +/- 1.2 and 3.2 +/- 1.9%, respectively, p = 0.03).\\ Only quinapril was associated with significant improvement in FMD, and this response is related to the presence of the insertion allele of the ACE genotype.}

   Abstract={Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy has received interest since the publication of the JNC-VI report. Relatively few head-to-head comparative studies between fixed-dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension have been published. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of various first-line monotherapies and the fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the efficacy and safety of the first-line monotherapies with amlodipine/benazepril. The meta-analysis included 82 studies that included 110 treatment groups (cohorts). The study compared nine different monotherapies and one combination therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled and 60 were active treatment controlled. The mean absolute decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 9.7 to 13.3 mm Hg with verapamil showing the greatest effect and captopril the least (13.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; 9.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively). When studies were weighted by sample size, atenolol, verapamil, lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest BP effect. When studies were weighted by variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed the greatest BP effect. The percentage of patients controlled on therapy ranged from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest percent controlled. The overall incidence of adverse effects ranged from 12.1% to 41.8% with lisinopril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The overall incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance ranged from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that amlodipine/benazepril produces above average reductions in BP with a lower than average incidence of overall side effects and the lowest incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance. The fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril achieves its goal of effective BP lowering with a minimum of significant side effects.}

Two of the patients in this group had angor pectoris with evidence of subepicardial ischaemia as seen in the first ECG, both of which disappeared with the drug. Heart rate decreased by 14%. Similarly, all patients in the nifedipine group had significant decreases in BP (190 +/- 23/115 +/- 7 to 153 +/- 26/86 +/- 6 mm Hg, P < 0.005). Their first ECG was normal. Two patients suffered angor pectoris after nifedipine, with subepicardial ischaemia registering in the second ECG. Heart rate increased 11.9% in this group. During the follow-up period, no clinically significant side effects or cases of rebound hypertension were observed in the ISA group, whereas in the nifedipine group, eight patients reported having headaches and four others rebound hypertension.\\ Our results show a favourable effect of ISA in the treatment of HE.}

   Abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. However, despite manifold publications reflecting numerous clinical trials about treatment of AF, the management of this arrhythmia is still under controversial discussion, in daily clinical work as well as in research. The present study concentrates on three major questions: 1. How frequent are recurrences of AF in long-term follow-up? Most of the previous studies used the occurrence of symptoms as a surrogate parameter for recurrences of AF, despite the expected high rate of asymptomatic relapses. In the present study a daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a rhythm monitoring independent of symptoms. 2. Is the frequency of AF recurrences significantly reduced by antiarrhythmic medication? A direct comparison of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs, which still are most frequently used for this indication, and of placebo will answer this question. 3. How safe is the long-term treatment for the prevention of AF recurrences with special respect to proarrhythmic effects? The daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of tachy- and bradyarrhythmias independent of symptoms. Additionally, the daily analysis of ECG measures may detect parameters predicting subsequent life threatening arrhythmias. The study design provides a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter parallel group comparison. In Germany and in the Czech Republic about 90 hospitals will include 900 patients with documented chronic AF, age 18 to 80 years, if they are eligible for electrical cardioversion without concomitant antiarrhythmic drug therapy and if they are anticoagulated for at least three weeks prior to inclusion. Neither the size of the left atrium nor the duration of chronic AF are exclusion criteria. A few hours after successful electrical cardioversion the patients are randomised either to sotalol (2 x 160 mg) or quinidine + verapamil (3 x 160 mg + 3 x 80 mg) or placebo. Starting at the day after cardioversion, the patient is asked to record and transmit electrocardiograms of one minute duration at least once a day using his personal transtelephonic ECG recording unit (Tele-ECG recorder, credit card size), in case of symptoms as often as necessary. The ECGs can be transmitted at any time by any regular phone without additional equipment using a toll free number. A custom made, computer based, fully automated receiving centre is handling the patient calls interactively with voice control, including a voice recording of the patient's symptoms. The ECG tracings and the patient's voice messages are subsequently computer based analysed by experienced technicians. All ECG measures are stored in a database. In case of AF recurrence, any other relevant arrhythmia or additional abnormalities (e.g. QT prolongation) the correspondent hospital is immediately informed by fax. In case of AF recurrence, a subsequent Holter recording discriminates in paroxysmal and permanent AF. Study medication is ended if either permanent AF or the third episode of paroxysmal AF are detected or after 12 months of follow-up. Regular follow-up visits are performed monthly. Major endpoints are the time to first recurrence of AF or the time to death, secondary parameters are the number of AF recurrences, the time to end of medication and AF related symptoms. The recruitment started in the last days of 1996. Until the end of June 1998, 424 patients have been randomised. It is expected to end recruitment in spring 1999 and to close the study in spring 2000. Final results will be available in summer 2000.}

   Abstract={This study compared the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a combination tablet containing the vascular-selective calcium antagonist felodipine and the beta1-selective adrenergic antagonist metoprolol, with a combination tablet of captopril-hydrochlorothiazide in a randomized, double-blind trial involving 109 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After 2 weeks on placebo, patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg were randomized to felodipine-metoprolol, 5/50 mg o.d. (Logimax) or captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 25/25 mg o.d. (Capozide). After a further 4 weeks, there was a mandatory dose increase to felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg o.d., and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 50/25 mg o.d., and treatment then continued for a another 4 weeks. At the end of the study, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide. The mean differences in change in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure between treatments after 8 weeks were 5.2 and 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (p<0.05). Standing blood pressure also showed trends in favour of felodipine-metoprolol. The proportion of responders was similar in both groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and 5 with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Felodipine-metoprolol combination reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide with maintained tolerability.}

   Abstract={To assess the efficacy and safety of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg bisoprolol/6. 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 2.5, 5, and 10 mg amlodipine; and 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg enalapril in subjects (n = 541) with a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 114 mm Hg, data from two comparative studies were pooled. All drugs were titrated to a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or less. Both studies were double-blind, randomized, parallel dose escalation trials with similar designs and included three active treatments. The second study also had a placebo group. The mean change from baseline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure for placebo (n = 79) was -0. 1/-2.2 mm Hg; amlodipine (n = 154), -12.4/-10.3 mm Hg; enalapril (n = 155), -9.4/-8.2 mm Hg; and bisoprolol/HCTZ (n = 155), -14.0/-12.0. Overall efficacy analyses documented a statistically significant decrease in sitting diastolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo, amlodipine, and enalapril. There was a significant reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo and enalapril but not amlodipine. Also, there was a significant decrease in sitting heart rate for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (-6.2 beats/min) compared with placebo (+0.1 beats/min), amlodipine (+1.2 beats/min), and enalapril (+0.5 beats/min). The control rate (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (66.5%) was significantly better than for placebo (21.8%) and enalapril (47.1%) but not amlodipine (58.4%). Of those patients achieving and maintaining control, 49% of the bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ subjects were on the lowest two doses compared with 30% of the amlodipine and 26% of the enalapril subjects. Percentages of patients reporting at least one drug-related adverse event through week 12 were 27%, 24%, 28%, and 25% for placebo, bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril (not significant). Lower doses of two drugs in fixed combination can provide as good or better blood pressure control compared with higher doses of a single drug with similar tolerability and safety.}

   Abstract={A single-center, prospective double-blind randomized trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine in a sustained release coat-core formulation (CC), titrated from 10 mg to 40 mg daily, with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, titrated from 10 to 40 mg daily, in the treatment of black South African patients with severe hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] between 115 and 140 mm Hg, confirmed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). Treatment target was a sitting DBP < 95 mm Hg by the 9th week of treatment. This was followed by a 4-month open phase using nisoldipine CC 10 to 60 mg daily. Ninety-six patients had complete data at baseline, and at the end of the double-blind and open phases, and were included in this analysis. In both groups, all patients required titration up to the maximal dose of double-blind medication. Monotherapy with nisoldipine CC, but not enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Twenty-four-hour BP in the nisoldipine CC group decreased from 179+/-14 / 118+/-7 to 144+/-16 / 94+/-10 mm Hg (P < .0001) versus 181+/-13 / 117+/-5 to 171+/-17 / 110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P = ns). The profound decrease in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index, observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146+/-40 to 129+/-35 g/m2, P = .05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (from 139+/-36 to 142+/-50 g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was further demonstrated in the open phase, during which 24-h BP decreased from 180+/-14 / 118+/-6 mm Hg (at baseline) to 142+/-16 / 92+/-10 mm Hg at the end of the 16-week open phase (P < .0001). This effect was sustained with trough-to-peak ratio of 74% for systolic and 67% for diastolic BP, with further regression in LV mass. Reduction in 24-h systolic BP to < 135 mm Hg was associated with a greater degree of regression of LV mass index in patients treated with nisoldipine CC. The incidence of adverse events in both groups was low and both nisoldipine CC and enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmia was also low and did not change with treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that nisoldipine CC administered once daily could be considered as a suitable first-line antihypertensive agent in black patients with severe hypertension, based on its profound and sustained blood-pressure-lowering effect, associated with significant regression of left ventricular mass and its low side effect profile.}

   Abstract={We compared antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a single administration of equipotent doses of lacidipine versus nifedipine in the hypertensive urgencies. Twenty-nine asymptomatic essential hypertensive patients (nine men, 20 women) with a mean age of 55.03+/-11.19 years and baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of > or =120 mm Hg after resting 30 min, not taking antihypertensive drugs for the last 24 h, were randomized in a single-blind fashion to receive lacidipine, 4 mg (LCD, 15 patients) or short-acting nifedipine, 20 mg (NFD, 14 patients) in a single dose. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were taken every 30 min during the first 8 h and every 2 h until 24 h of follow-up. Baseline BP values were similar in the two groups (LCD, 222.5+/-32.8/124.6+/-8.4 mm Hg vs. NFD, 215.9+/-20.6/128+/-7.7 mm Hg; p = NS). Both drugs promoted a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP; 169.6+/-27.8 vs. 170.6+/-25.3 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; 104.1+/-16 vs. 102.9+/-12.4 mm Hg) after 8 h. However, either SBP (165+/-27.3 vs. 190.6+/-18.2 mm Hg; p = 0.008) and DBP (99.9+/-12.3 vs. 117.2+/-11.4 mm Hg; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the NFD group after 24-h dosing. Eleven patients in the LCD group had a decrease in BP >25% of the baseline value both 8 and 24 h after the dose. Although 10 patients showed the same response in the NFD group 8 h after the dose, only four patients maintained these values at 24 h. One patient treated with NFD had a transient cerebrovascular ischemic attack. No adverse effects were observed in the LCD group. We conclude that the long-acting calcium antagonist lacidipine was more effective than the short-acting nifedipine in both controlling BP and maintaining this BP reduction over 8 h in essential hypertensive patients with acute asymptomatic BP increase.}

   Abstract={In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, 120 out-patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were randomised, after a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period, to a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50 mg (Logimax, Mobloc, Astra) once daily or enalapril 10 mg once daily. If blood pressure (BP) remained suboptimally controlled after 4 weeks (supine diastolic BP >90 mm Hg 24-h post dose), the dose was doubled for a further 4 weeks. After 8 weeks felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine BP significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmHg and 11.1/7.2 mm Hg, respectively). The mean differences in change in BP between treatments were 8.6/4.8 mm Hg in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (P = 0.001/P <0.001). A statistically significant difference to the advantage of felodipine-metoprolol was also seen in standing BP. Even though the dose was increased in a larger proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate BP control (41% vs 63% on felodipine-metoprolol, P <0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A similar number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. In conclusion, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once daily reduced BP more effectively than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily 24 h post dose. The result was expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. Obviously, a considerable BP reduction may be well tolerated, as was the main purpose to demonstrate in this study.}

This was tested by analyzing data from patients who had taken part in the Circadian Anti-ischemia Program in Europe (CAPE) trial. After a 2-week, single-blind, run-in period (Phase 1), patients were randomized to amlodipine, 5 mg/day (first 4 weeks) and 10 mg/day (second 4 weeks), or placebo for 8 weeks (Phase 2). The 48-h Holter data were analyzed for 167 amlodipine-treated patients and 83 placebo patients based on a 2:1 randomization scheme. Sixty-three per cent of amlodipine patients and 67% of placebo patients were receiving concomitant BBLs, and >90% had taken sublingual nitrates during anginal attacks, as basic antiischemic therapy. After 7 weeks of therapy, when 48-h Holter monitoring was repeated, there were no significant changes in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in the placebo or amlodipine groups for all patients or subgroups of patients with or without BBLs. Also, between-group comparisons showed no significant differences in arrhythmias between amlodipine and placebo patients. In summary, amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) given to patients with severe, chronic CAD receiving conventional antiischemic therapy, did not produce any proarrhythmic effects.}

   Abstract={One hundred patients were tested prior to otologic ear surgery in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to assess the perioperative efficiacy of a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) in preventing acoustical trauma during middle ear surgery. The patients were randomly divided into a therapy group (diltiazem), and a control group (placebo). Bone conduction hearing thresholds were examined preoperatively and followed at 1 day and 3 months postoperatively. Frequency-dependent changes in postoperative bone conduction and the number of patients with various degrees of postoperative hearing loss in both groups were statistically analyzed. The results indicated only a small postoperative hearing loss after ear surgery in both groups. There was a tendency for better results in the therapy group but this was not found to be statistically significant. Despite favorable results in animal trials utilizing different kinds of noise with the prophylactic application of diltiazem, further studies in humans will be needed to determine the role of calcium antagonist drugs in the prophylaxis or treatment of acoustical trauma.}

   Abstract={Uncontrolled studies have suggested that atrioventricular junction ablation and pacemaker implantation have beneficial effects on quality of life in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF).\\ We performed a multicenter, controlled, randomized, 12-month evaluation of the clinical effects of atrioventricular junction ablation and VVIR pacemaker (Abl+Pm) versus pharmacological (drug) treatment in 66 patients with chronic (lasting >6 months) AF who had clinically manifest heart failure and heart rate >90 bpm on 3 standard ECGs recorded at rest during stable clinical conditions on different days. Before completion of the study, withdrawals occurred in 8 patients of the drug group and in 4 patients of the Abl+Pm group. At the end of the 12 months, the 28 Abl+Pm patients who completed the study showed lower scores in palpitations (-78%; P=0.000) and effort dyspnea (-22%; P=0.05) than the 26 of the drug group. Lower scores, although not significant, were also observed for exercise intolerance (-20%), easy fatigue (-17%), chest discomfort (-50%), Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (-14%), New York Heart Association functional classification (-4%), and Activity scale (-12%). The intrapatient comparison between enrollment and month 12 showed that in the Abl+Pm group, all variables except easy fatigue improved significantly from 14% to 82%. However, because an improvement was also observed in the drug group, the difference between the 2 groups was significant only for palpitations (P=0.000), effort dyspnea (P=0.01), exercise intolerance (P=0.005), easy fatigue (P=0.02), and chest discomfort (P=0.02). Cardiac performance, evaluated by means of standard echocardiogram and exercise test, did not differ significantly between the 2 groups and remained stable over time.\\ In patients with heart failure and chronic AF, Abl+Pm treatment is effective and superior to drug therapy in controlling symptoms, although its efficacy appears to be less than that observed in uncontrolled studies because some improvement can also be expected in medically treated patients. Cardiac performance is not modified by the treatment.}

   Abstract={The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a calcium antagonist has become a common way of treating patients with essential hypertension who respond insufficiently to monotherapy. This double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicenter, outpatient study evaluated the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a calcium antagonist (verapamil SR) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril) in patients with mild-to-moderate (stages I and II) essential hypertension. Six hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled in this 10-week study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo phase, patients received one of the following daily dosage regimens in a double-blind fashion for 6 weeks: placebo, 4 mg of trandolapril, 240 mg of verapamil SR, or a combination of 4 mg of trandolapril and 240 mg of verapamil SR. Trough sitting diastolic blood pressure was lowered by 4.5 mm Hg, 4.3 mm Hg, and 8.1 mm Hg more than placebo in the trandolapril, verapamil SR, and combination groups, respectively. In the combination group, sitting diastolic blood pressure was significantly lowered (P < .01) by 3.6 mm Hg more than in the trandolapril group and by 3.8 mm Hg more than in the verapamil SR group. An analysis of the trough-to-peak ratio for sitting diastolic blood pressure revealed values of 0.75 and 0.67, for the 4-mg trandolapril and the combination groups, respectively, at end point. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar for all treatment groups. In this study the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium antagonist was well tolerated and more effective than either agent administered alone for the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.}

   Abstract={The Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study is a prospective trial conducted in 26 countries. The aims are to (1) evaluate the relationship between three levels of target office diastolic blood pressure (BP) (< or = 80, < or = 85, or < or = 90 mm Hg) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients and (2) examine the effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of 75 mg aspirin daily versus placebo. A total of 19,193 patients between 50 and 80 years of age had been randomized by the end of April 1994. Treatment was initiated with felodipine 5 mg daily, and additional therapy was given in accordance with a set protocol. The present substudy of 926 patients performed in nine countries aimed to (1) compare home with office BP in a representative subsample of the HOT population after the titration of treatment was completed and (2) clarify whether the separation into the target groups could be expanded into the out-of-office setting. The differences between office and home measurements in diastolic BP of 0.2 mm Hg (SD, 9; 95% confidence interval, -0.36 to 0.81; P=.40) and systolic BP of 0.5 mm Hg (SD, 15; 95% confidence interval, -0.53 to 1.46; P=.21) were not significant. The group differences in home BP were 1.9 mm Hg (< or = 80 versus < or = 85) and 1.2 mm Hg (< or = 85 versus < or = 90) for diastolic BP (F=11.69; ANOVA, P<.0001) and 2.6 and 2.1 mm Hg for systolic BP (F=8.44, P=.0002). Thus, office and home BPs measured with the same semiautomatic device are comparable in treated hypertensive subjects in the HOT Study, and the separation into the target groups based on office readings prevails at home.}

   Abstract={It has been suggested that long term treatment with calcium antagonist drugs might inhibit platelet function and lead to an anti-atheromatous effect. However recent data have also suggested that such an effect might increase mortality due to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. We identified 43 subjects from general practice with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension to compare the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine with that of the beta-blocker atenolol on platelet function, plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels, fibrinolysis, and serum lipids in a randomised double-blind parallel group study. After careful evaluation to exclude concomitant aspirin use, only 24 subjects were eligible to enter the study. While isradipine and atenolol produced comparable and clinically significant falls in blood pressure (167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 153 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, and 165 +/- 2/101 +/- 1 to 156 +/- 4/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), neither drug produced a detectable effect on ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet retention, or thromboxane generation with adrenaline, collagen, adenosine-di-phosphate, or platelet activating factor. However a decrease in plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels was observed which reached statistical significance (P < 0.05) after 12 weeks treatment in the isradipine but not the atenolol group. A 39% reduction with isradipine compared with 34% following atenolol treatment. Euglobulin clot lysis time was not altered by either drug. Serum cholesterol concentrations were also unaltered by drug treatment. Therapeutic doses of the calcium antagonist isradipine may produce a minor indirect effect on platelet function after several weeks of treatment. However, this is of doubtful clinical importance and may simply reflect an effect of lowered blood pressure on platelet function.}

   Abstract={To compare the efficacy of the Valsalva maneuver with that of carotid sinus massage (CSM) in terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in the ED.\\ This prospective, randomized case study was performed in the ED of a tertiary care institution. Patients were at least 10 years of age with regular narrow complex tachycardia and had an ECG diagnosis of SVT. Patients with regular narrow complex tachycardia were randomly assigned to undergo either the Valsalva maneuver or CSM. If the tachycardia was not terminated by the method chosen by randomization, then the alternative method of vagal maneuver was used. If the tachycardia was not converted by both methods of vagal stimulation, patients would undergo either synchronized electrical cardioversion or a pharmacologic method of conversion at the discretion of the treating physician, depending on the patient's hemodynamic status.\\ One hundred forty-eight instances of SVT were studied Sixty-two patients underwent Valsalva maneuver first with conversion in 12 (success rate of 19.4%). Eighty-six underwent CSM first with conversion in 9 (success rate 10.5%). Carotid sinus massage was used in the 50 cases of SVT in which conversion was not achieved with the Valsalva maneuver. Conversion occurred in 7 cases (success rate 14.0%). For the 77 cases of SVT in which initial CSM did not achieve conversion, conversion occurred in 13 with the Valsalva maneuver (success rate 16.9%). The Valsalva maneuver and CSM achieved conversion in a total of 41 instances of SVT (success rate 27.7%).\\ Vagal maneuvers are efficacious in terminating about one quarter of spontaneous SVT cases. There is no detectable difference in efficacy between the Valsalva maneuver and CSM.}

   Abstract={Nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) is an extended-release dosage formulation that provides sustained blood concentrations of nifedipine over 24 hours. A 20-week, postmarketing surveillance study of the effectiveness and patient tolerability of nifedipine GITS 30 or 60 mg was conducted in the offices of 187 Canadian general practitioners from September 1992 to March 1994. A total of 1700 patients previously or newly diagnosed with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 114 mm Hg) were included. The 20-week treatment period was completed by 1326 patients. Patients received nifedipine GITS 30 mg initially; the dose could be titrated upward to 60 mg after 3 and 6 weeks. Of all patients entered, 605 (35.6%) reported one or more adverse events. The three most frequently occurring adverse events were headache (12.2%), peripheral edema (8.1%), and dizziness (2.9%). The frequency of adverse events was highest in the first 3 weeks and decreased subsequently. The overall incidence of adverse events was 29.8% in patients receiving 30 mg of nifedipine GITS and 25.3% in those receiving 60 mg; adverse events were the cause of study discontinuation in 12.3% of patients. The overall health status of patients as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire was comparable to that previously reported for healthy individuals. At baseline, mean (+/- SE) systolic/diastolic blood pressure values for all patients were 160.1 +/- 0.4/97.4 +/- 0.2 mm Hg. Final blood pressure readings after 20 weeks of treatment in the 30-mg group (141.5 +/- 0.4/84.8 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and the 60-mg group (146.6 +/- 0.8/88.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg) were significantly decreased from baseline. At week 20, the 30-mg dose was sufficient to maintain blood pressure in 74.5% of patients; 25.5% of patients required 60 mg. Subgroup analysis revealed similar responses in patients who had received blood pressure medication before study initiation and those who had not. Response was also independent of age and type of previous antihypertensive therapy. In general medical practice, the 30-mg and 60-mg doses of nifedipine GITS were both effective and well tolerated and had minimal or no negative effects on the overall health status of treated individuals.}

   Abstract={The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of AV junction ablation and pacemaker implantation on quality of life and specific symptoms in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) not controlled by drugs.\\ We performed a multicenter, randomized, 6-month evaluation of the clinical effects of AV junction ablation and DDDR mode-switching pacemaker (Abl+Pm) versus pharmacological treatment in 43 patients with intolerable, recurrent paroxysmal AF of three or more episodes in the previous 6 months not controlled with three or more antiarrhythmic drugs. Before completion of the study, 3 patients in the drug group withdrew because of the severity of their symptoms and 1 patient assigned to the Abl+Pm group in whom the ablation procedure failed. At the end of the 6 months, the 21 patients of the Abl+Pm group who completed the study showed, in comparison with the 18 of the drug group, lower scores in the Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (-51%, P=.0006), palpitations (-71%, P=.0000), effort dyspnea (-36%, P=.04), exercise intolerance score (-46%, P=.001), and easy fatigue (-51%, P=.02). The scores for rest dyspnea, chest discomfort, and NYHA functional classification were also lower (-56%, -50%, and -17%, respectively) in the Abl+Pm group, although not significantly. At the end of the study, palpitations were no longer present in 81% of the Abl+Pm group and in 11% of the drug group (P=.0000). AF was documented in 31 of 122 visits (25%) in the Abl+Pm group and in 9 of 107 examinations (8%) in the drug group (P=.0005); chronic AF developed in 5 (24%) and 0 (0%) in the two groups, respectively (P=.04).\\ In patients with paroxysmal AF not controlled by pharmacological therapy, Abl+Pm treatment is highly effective and superior to drug therapy in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life. The discontinuation of drug therapy exposes patients to further recurrences of paroxysmal AF and the risk of developing permanent AF.}

After a 2-week placebo and 4-week single-blind benazepril, 10 mg once daily, run-in period, 448 patients, 213 men and 235 women, aged 24-73 years (mean, 55 years), with mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or =95 and < or =120 mm Hg at the end of the benazepril run-in period, were randomized to receive one of the following treatments once daily for 8 weeks: (a) benazepril, 10 mg, plus placebo (BZ10); (b) benazepril, 10 mg, plus amlodipine, 2.5 mg (BZ10/AML2.5); or (c) benazepril, 10 mg, plus amlodipine, 5 mg (BZ10/AML5). Before the patients were admitted to the trial, at the end of the placebo run-in and the benazepril run-in period and at the end of weeks 4 and 8 of the treatment period, sitting and standing blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and body weight were measured 22-26 h after the intake of the trial medication. Both BZ10/AML2.5 and BZ10/AML5 combinations showed better antihypertensive activity than did BZ10 monotherapy at the terminal visit as demonstrated by (a) the 24-h postdosing sitting and standing systolic BP (SBP) and DBP values, which were statistically lower with combination therapy than with BZ10; (b) the success rate, which was statistically higher with both the combinations (69.2% in the BZ10/AML2.5 and 65.8% in the BZ10/AML5 group) compared with the BZ10 group (40.5%). The tolerability was good in the three treatment groups. No significant abnormal laboratory data were detected. There was no difference in efficacy and safety/tolerability between the BZ10/AML2.5 and BZ10/AML5 groups.}

   Abstract={A multiple drug regimen consisting of trandolapril, verapamil and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were sequentially added in an open-label evaluation of patients with severe hypertension. Ninety patients (58 white and 32 black patients) were titrated on one or more drugs and followed for a 19-week maintenance period. Statistically significant (P = 0.001) mean (+/-s.d.) decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 9.0 (+/-9.3) mm Hg for trandolapril, 13.9 (+/-11.0) mm Hg for the trandolapril + verapamil (TV) combination, and 19.0 (+/-12.3) mm Hg when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the combination. The decrease in BP observed on TV combination therapy plus HCTZ was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease observed for the TV combination, which was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease observed for trandolapril monotherapy. Clinical responder rates were 44.8%, 56% and 77.7% for trandolapril monotherapy, trandolapril + verapamil combination therapy and triple therapy, respectively. Black and white patients had similar response rates, but black patients appeared to benefit more from the addition of HCTZ; 20% of black patients achieved a post-treatment supine DBP <90 mm Hg compared to 12.8% of white patients. This study demonstrates that the addition of verapamil to trandolapril has an additive effect on BP that is maintained throughout the day.}

   Abstract={The objective of this study was retrospectively to evaluate both in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and non-IVF cycles in which the male partner had been taking calcium channel blockers, either to confirm or refute previous data from another centre, suggesting that these drugs cause a severe but reversible subfertility problem in the male. These drugs were found to inhibit expression of mannose-ligand binding receptors, thus preventing spermatozoa from attaching to the zona pellucida; they were postulated to cause failed fertilization based on one case having this defect, in whom a return to normal was achieved after stopping the drug. However, the couple did not undergo a cycle with IVF to see if fertilization now occurred. The data presented here demonstrated fertilization in all patients having IVF who were taking calcium channel blockers. The subsequent pregnancy rate per transfer was 17.4%. Also, five out of 11 (45.4%) non-IVF patients conceived after correction of various female factors. Failure of the other six patients to conceive could be explained by other confounding factors, especially oligoasthenozoospermia. Taking into consideration other data suggesting poor fertilization when this mannose-ligand binding receptor abnormality was demonstrated, we propose the possibility that this defect, when not associated with calcium channel blockers, may be associated with some other cryptic factor that causes poor fertilization. According to our hypothesis, calcium channel blockers might cause the problem in mannose expression but also adversely affect some other factor that is deficient when non-drug related abnormalities in mannose-ligand binding expression are found.}

   Abstract={Calcium channel blockers are known to contribute to gingival hyperplasia. The vast majority of reports discuss patients taking the drug nifedipine. During the past few years a newer calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, has been used with increasing frequency. To date, six cases have been published indicating that amlodipine may also promote gingival hyperplasia; however, no data have been reported regarding the prevalence of this phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to examine a large group of patients taking amlodipine and determine the prevalence of gingival hyperplasia. One hundred fifty dentate patients who had been taking amlodipine, 5 mg per day for at least 6 months, volunteered to undergo a screening examination for gingival hyperplasia. Mild hyperplasia (< 1/3 clinical crown) was found in five patients-a prevalence of 3.3%. This is significantly less (P < .001) than rates reported for patients taking nifedipine, and not significantly different from rates previously reported in control groups of cardiac patients not taking calcium channel blockers. The results from this group of patients indicated that amlodipine, 5 mg per day, did not induce gingival hyperplasia.}

   Abstract={Patients with nifedipine-induced gingival hyperplasia (GH) often require continued calcium channel blocker therapy. Switches to diltiazem and verapamil have been described; however, these drugs are of a different chemical class and present therapeutic limitations in some patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on nifedipine-induced GH of a switch to a dihydropyridine derivative with a low incidence of GH. Fourteen patients with nifedipine-induced GH were given a medical exam and a periodontal exam. The following parameters were assessed: probing depth (PD), gingival margin (GM), gingival thickness (GT), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI). Intraoral photographs, study models, and a gingival biopsy for histological examination were taken. Following baseline measures, patients were randomized to continued treatment with nifedipine or an equivalent dose of isradipine in a single-blind fashion. Biweekly periodontal parameters were taken for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, some patients elected to receive 4 weeks of open label isradipine therapy, with biweekly examination continuing through the open label phase. The isradipine treatment arm showed a mean decrease in PD of 0.59 mm at week 8 (P < 0.05). No other measured parameter (GM, GT, PI, GI) was significantly changed, compared either to baseline or to the alternate treatment arm. Clinically, 60% of patients treated with isradipine exhibited a decrease in hyperplasia, while 66% of patients treated with nifedipine demonstrated an increase in hyperplasia, a significant difference (P < 0.05). When combined with open label data, patients switching therapy to isradipine exhibited an increase in GM (increase in recession) of 0.74 mm from baseline to week 12 (P < 0.05). No patients treated with isradipine exhibited an increase in gingival overgrowth. All patients exhibited adequate control of hypertension. We conclude that in hypertensive patients with nifedipine-induced GH, switching hypertensive therapy to isradipine may result in a regression of GH. When coupled with aggressive oral hygiene treatment, this drug may provide a reasonable option for patients requiring dihydropyridine treatment.}

   Abstract={Essential hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Atenolol, a cardio-selective beta-blocker, has been shown to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent. The extended-release form of felodipine (felodipine ER), a vascular-selective dihydropyridine calcium blocker, is extensively used in Caucasians. However, its effectiveness, tolerability and adverse side-effect have not been assessed in Chinese populations.\\ Sitting blood pressure (BP), heart rate, body weight, adverse reaction and serum biochemistry were assessed in 70 patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension treated either with felodipine ER (37 patients), or atenolol (33 patients) for 10 weeks. Each patient was prescribed 5 mg of felodipine ER or 50 mg of atenolol once daily and this daily dosage was doubled to twice daily if necessary.\\ Six patients who received felodipine ER and 3 who received atenolol withdrew from the treatment because of intolerable side effects. Within ten weeks, 81.1% of the patients had responded to a total daily dosage of 5-10 mg of felodipine ER and 81.8% to a daily dose of 50-100 mg of atenolol. By the end of treatment, the mean BP in the felodipine ER group had decreased from 176/104 mmHg at baseline to 145/85 mmHg, while the BP in the atenolol group had dropped from 173/103 mmHg to 145/84 mmHg (NS between the two groups). Heart rate declined in the atenolol group but did not change in patients who received felodipine ER. Overall, patients in the felodipine ER group had a higher rate of adverse reaction (70.3% vs. 39.4%; p < 0.001), and 16.2% of the patients in the felodipine ER group experienced symptoms of hypotension.\\ Equivalent doses of felodipine ER and atenolol are effective first-line monotherapeutic agents for the treatment of mild-moderate essential hypertension.}

   Abstract={Calcium antagonists have previously been shown to be effective in the treatment of mania. In the present study we used dextroamphetamine administered to humans as a model of mania, to determine whether the calcium antagonist diltiazem would prevent dextroamphetamine-induced changes. This may help determine whether diltiazem is likely to be useful in the treatment of mania. Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study. Subjects received either oral diltiazem (60 mg) and placebo, placebo and dextroamphetamine (20 mg), diltiazem and dextroamphetamine, or placebo alone. Subjective and sleep changes were measured using visual analogue scales. Attentiveness and visual reaction times were measured repeatedly as were diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The results showed that dextroamphetamine alone produced a number of subjective changes, cardiovascular changes and changes in reaction time. Diltiazem significantly attenuated the cardiovascular changes, but not the subjective or reaction time changes. It is hypothesized that these findings may represent effects of diltiazem on noradrenergic neurotransmission. The results are tentatively supportive of suggestions that diltiazem may be clinically useful in the treatment of mania, as is another calcium channel antagonist, verapamil.}

   Abstract={We report the efficacy of therapy over 5 years follow-up in 758 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients in a prospective, randomised controlled study of therapy of mild hypertension. Patients were recruited who on antihypertensive therapy had systolic blood pressure over 150 mmHg or diastolic over 85 mmHg, or if not on therapy had systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg or diastolic over 90 mmHg. Their mean blood pressure at entry to the study was 160/94 mmHg at a mean age of 57 years. They were allocated to tight control (aiming for systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or to less tight control (aiming for systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The tight control group were allocated to primary therapy either with a beta blocker (atenolol) or with an antiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), with addition of other agents as required. Over 5 years, the mean blood pressure in the tight control group was significantly lower (143/82 vs 154/88 mmHg, p < 0.001). No difference was seen between those allocated to atenolol or captopril. The proportion of patients requiring three or more antihypertensive therapies to maintain tight control in those allocated to atenolol or captopril increased from 16 and 15%, respectively at 2 years to 25 and 26%, respectively at 5 years, whereas in the less tight control group at 2 and 5 years only 5 and 7%, respectively required three or more therapies. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects or hypoglycaemic episodes between those allocated to atenolol or captopril, but those allocated to atenolol increased their body weight by a mean of 2.3 kg compared with 0.5 kg in those allocated to captopril (p < 0.01). Allocation to atenolol was also associated with small increases in triglyceride, and decreases in LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are of uncertain clinical relevance. The study is continuing to determine whether the improved blood pressure control, which was obtained, will be beneficial in maintaining the health of patients by decreasing the incidence of major clinical complications, principally myocardial infarction and strokes, and microvascular complications, such as severe retinopathy requiring photocoagulation and deterioration of renal function.}

After a 14 days' placebo period they were treated with a combination of 20 mg retarded nifedipine and 25 or 50 mg atenolol for six weeks each. Group A started with 25 mg, group B with 50 mg atenolol. Casual sitting blood pressure was measured automatically every second week, routine laboratory parameters and side effects were evaluated at the end of placebo and the verum periods. The blood pressure of the two groups was comparable during placebo and was reduced by 31.6/14.7 mmHg in group A or 29.9/15.8 mmHg in group B (p < 0.001 vs. placebo) after six weeks. In the second treatment period with verum, blood pressure was not further reduced. Both combinations were equally efficient also in the female and the elder subgroups (> 60 years) who were characterized by higher systolic blood pressure. The response rates were 83% and 86% for the combination with 25 and 50 mg atenolol respectively. Heart rate was significantly reduced in all groups during 50 mg atenolol. Laboratory parameters were not altered by treatment. Frequency and severeness of side effects were equal in both groups. It is concluded that in patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension the combination of 20 mg retarded nifedipine with 25 mg atenolol is equally efficient to the combination with 50 mg atenolol.}

   Abstract={In 102 cases of severe hypertension (DBP > or = 115 mm Hg), with or without acute complications, efficacy and safety of SL Nifedipine 10 mg (NIF), SL Captopril 25 mg (CAP), IV Metoprolol 15 mg (MET) and SL NIF + IV MET were studied in an inpatient trial. Maximum mean percent reduction in SBP was 13.3, 9.7, 15.7 and 19.9 and in DBP was 21.2, 13.9, 12.5 and 20.4 with NIF, CAP, MET and NIF + MET respectively. A safe DBP of < or = 110 mm Hg (Kaplan) was achieved in 90, 61, 72.2 and 95.2 percent of patients. A statistically significant fall in DBP was observed at 5 minutes with all regimens except CAP which was at 15 minutes. Mild side effects observed were palpitations and flushing (NIF n = 4), taste disturbances (CAP n = 3), heaviness of head (CAP n = 1) and giddiness (MET n = 2, NIF + MET n = 2). The trial data suggest that hypertensive crisis can be managed, without intensive care facility, with all four regimens; this implies significant cost containment.}

Patients were randomised to receive either the combination preparation (D 150 mg/H 12.5 mg), diltiazem (150 mg) or hydrochlorthiazide (12.5 mg). The dosage was increased in three patients who had not attained target blood pressure (BP) control after 6 weeks.\\ Response to treatment assessed by change from baseline in clinic and 24 h ambulatory BP.\\ The proportion of patients achieving target BP (a reduction in resting supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to below 90 mm Hg or a reduction of 10 mm Hg from baseline) was 80% in the combination group, 55% in the diltiazem group, and 38% in the hydrochlorothiazide group. The respective figures for reduction in supine DBP from baseline were 13.5 mm Hg, 11.2 mm Hg and 5.9 mm Hg. A similar treatment order appeared throughout each of the efficacy variables. BP control throughout the 24 h dosing interval was demonstrated by ambulatory BP monitoring. Each treatment was well tolerated.\\ This study provides clear evidence of the efficacy of combination therapy with diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide in the management of patients with hypertension.}

   Abstract={The efficacy and tolerability of a twice-daily dose of 5 mg of nisoldipine versus 40 mg of sustained-release isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) were compared in a randomized, double-masked study in 91 patients. During the 21-day treatment period, the mean time taken during bicycle ergometry to the appearance of an ST segment depression of at least 0.1 mV compared with the resting value increased from 287 +/- 129 seconds to 391 +/- 150 seconds in the nisoldipine group and from 254 +/- 140 seconds to 350 +/- 191 seconds in the ISDN group. The mean value at the end of treatment calculated by using analysis of covariance was 383 seconds in both groups. The difference between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. The mean ST segment depression at individually maximal workload decreased from 0.19 +/- 0.07 mV to 0.12 +/- 0.08 mV in the nisoldipine group and from 0.18 +/- 0.07 mV to 0.14 +/- 0.08 mV in the ISDN group. The mean total duration of exercise increased from 420 +/- 161 seconds to 497 +/- 140 seconds in the nisoldipine group and from 425 +/- 167 seconds to 456 +/- 168 seconds in the ISDN group. In the nisoldipine group, 9 patients reported 12 adverse events that were considered to be possibly or probably related to the test medication; in the ISDN group, 13 patients reported 26 adverse events. Although the anti-ischemic effect of the two treatments was comparable, nisoldipine was descriptively superior to ISDN in terms of tolerability.}

   Abstract={The present study was designated to assess the effects of two different dyhydropyridine calcium antagonists (DHPCAs) on proteinuria in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The hypothesis that similar levels of blood pressure reduction with two different DHPCAs produce similar degrees of proteinuria reduction was tested. In a prospective randomized study, 14 patients with NIDDM, hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency were given either isradipine (n = 7) or nifedipine XL (n = 7) for 6 months. After a 2-week washout period, patients were crossed over to the other drug and observed for an additional 6 months. Drugs were titrated to lower arterial pressure to < 140/90 mmHg. Patients also instructed to follow a low-sodium diet at the initial visit. Blood pressure and 24-hour urine values for creatinine clearance, albuminuria, proteinuria, and sodium were assessed monthly. At the end of the initial and crossover treatment periods, there were no significant reductions in the level of albuminuria from baseline with either drug. Sodium excretion was < 110 mEq/L with each drug tested. The results of this study support the concept that DHPCAs do not reduce proteinuria in patients with type II diabetes. This failure to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria occurred despite adequate blood pressure reduction and an effort at dietary sodium restriction.}

   Abstract={In order to clarify a possible pathophysiological role of medullasin, a neutrophil elastase-like proteinase, in nifedipine (NF)-induced gingival overgrowth, the distributions of medullasin-positive cells immunostained in specimens from patients with NF-induced gingival overgrowth and chronic marginal gingivitis were compared in three different biopsy areas. Twenty gingival biopsies were obtained from five patients with gingival overgrowth and 20 biopsies from another five patients with chronic marginal gingivitis. In the marginal gingivitis group, the mean percentage of positive cells in the vicinity of pocket epithelium (zone I) was significantly higher than in the areas of connective tissue of the mid-portion (zone II) and adjacent to oral epithelium ( zone III) (p < 0.05). In the gingival overgrowth group, on the contrary, the positive cells significantly increased in zone II as compared with zones I and III (p < 0.05). Further, medullasin-positive cells of zones II and III in the overgrowth group had infiltrated more extensively than those in the gingivitis group (p < 0.001), indicating the participation of this enzyme in the mechanism of NF-induced gingival overgrowth. These observations suggest that medullasin may play a part in NF-induced overgrowth both in host defence and in immunoregulation, possibly cytotoxically.}

Blood pressure values for nifedipine-PA 20 mg patients were unchanged after conversion to nifedipine-GITS; 74 patients received nifedipine-GITS 30 mg and 14 patients required titration up to nifedipine-GITS 60 mg daily. Sixteen patients withdrew on nifedipine-PA and five withdrew on nifedipine-GITS, mostly for reasons unrelated to drug therapy. Twenty-three patients experienced adverse events on nifedipine-PA versus 20 patients on nifedipine-GITS therapy.\\ Patients whose hypertension is controlled by nifedipine-PA 10 or 20 mg bid can be successfully converted to nifedipine-GITS with most patients remaining normotensive on 30 mg daily.}

   Abstract={A double-blind, placebo-controlled study using anistreplase was performed in 159 patients with unstable angina. All patients had a history of unstable angina combined with typical ECG changes and without evidence of a previous, recent, or ongoing myocardial infarction. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the relationship between the patency of the culprit artery and the behavior of the ischemia-related regional left ventricular (LV) wall motion.\\ On entry to the study, all patients received conventional drug therapy: i.v. nitroglycerin therapy, an oral beta-blocking agent, and a calcium antagonist. Baseline angiography was carried out within 3 h after randomization, a mean of 4.2 +/- 3.0 h (range, 1 to 17 h) after the last attack of chest pain. Treatment with trial medication was withheld in 33 cases. Sixty-five patients with coronary artery disease received anistreplase (30 U/5 min)/heparin and 61 patients heparin-only therapy. Angiography was repeated 20.6 +/- 4.6 h (mean +/- SD; range, 12 to 39 h) after the baseline angiographic study. To assess changes in regional myocardial wall motion, the LV wall was divided into seven segments. The ischemia-related coronary artery stenosis was calculated quantitatively and related to the quantitatively assessed mean regional left ventricular ejection fraction (RLVEF) of the ischemia-related segments. In 118 of 126 patients who received trial medication, we found that anistreplase/heparin therapy leads to a significantly (p < 0.01) greater reduction in coronary artery diameter stenosis than heparin-only therapy (n = 63, mean +/- SD, 11 +/- 22, vs n = 55, mean +/- SD, 3 +/- 11%). Anistreplase/heparin therapy was related to a larger significant improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than heparin-only therapy, although the latter association was not statistically significant (n = 63, mean +/- SD, 7 +/- 15, vs n = 55, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 14%). The effects of change of coronary artery stenosis on regional LV wall motion were also determined. A paradoxical finding was that a persistently occluded vessel or a vessel showing an increase in coronary artery stenosis was associated with a greater improvement of the ischemia-related RLVEF than a reopened vessel or a vessel with a reduction in coronary artery stenosis (n = 15, mean +/- SD, 7 +/- 11, vs n = 41, mean +/- SD, 8 +/- 13, vs n = 15, mean +/- SD, 1 +/- 12, vs n = 47, mean +/- SD, 5 +/- 16%, NS). One day after the last attack of chest pain, the regional LV wall motion was still abnormal in about 20% of patients.\\ In these patients with unstable angina, the LV wall motion improved both in the treated and the control group at follow-up angiography 1 day later. Improved coronary arterial anatomy was associated with a lesser improvement of the LV contractile function than when worsening of the coronary angiographic appearance occurred. There is no rational explanation of these results. This is a beginning of an effort to elucidate the clinical significance of the stunned and hibernating myocardium in humans.}

Exercise variables measured included final exercise stage; presence of exercise-induced angina or ischemia; time to angina; time to 1-mm ST segment depression; number of exercise ECG leads with abnormalities; maximal depth of ST segment depression in any lead; sum of ST segment depression; ST/HR index; and rate-pressure product at time to angina, at time to 1-mm ST segment depression and at peak exertion.\\ Peak exercise time was increased by 0.5, 0.7 and 1.6 min in patients assigned to the angina-guided, ischemia-guided and coronary revascularization strategies, respectively, from the qualifying visit to the 12-week visit (p < 0.001). At the qualifying visit, the sum of exercise-induced ST segment depression was 9.4 +/- 5.0 (mean +/- SD), 9.6 +/- 4.7 and 9.9 +/- 5.5 mm (p = NS) in the three treatment strategies, respectively. At the 12-week visit, the sum of exercise-induced ST segment depression was 7.4 +/- 5.7, 6.8 +/- 5.3 and 5.6 +/- 5.6 mm (p = 0.02) in the three treatment strategies, respectively. Each treatment strategy resulted in a significant reduction in all exercise-induced variables of myocardial ischemia measured at 12 weeks.\\ Coronary revascularization significantly reduced the extent and frequency of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia compared with either medical strategy. The prognostic impact of these observations should be evaluated in a large-scale multicenter clinical trial.}

The method was reproducible and reliable. Our findings showed significant differences in papillary and gingival surface between controls and transplant patients treated with GO inducers. Gingival overgrowth index also differed significantly between controls and each patient group (p < 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test). The administration of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine potentiated the adverse effect of CsA: comparison of the morphometric findings revealed significant differences between patients treated with CsA alone and CsA+nifedipine in papillary area, dental area, and GO index (p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test). We conclude that the method of image analysis we developed is useful in assessing the degree of GO.}

Ten each of the hypertensive patients were treated with captopril, atenolol, or verapamil. Physical examination and biochemical analyses (serum Mg and Zn) were done in all participants at baseline, and in patients after 3 and 6 months of treatment. The results were compared according to a nested design with Neumann-Keuls test. We found no significant differences between controls and patients in serum and intraerythrocyte concentrations of Zn at the start of the study, although there was a significant decrease in serum Zn in patients after 3 (P < .01) and 6 months (P < .001) of treatment, regardless of the drug used. This decrease was thought to be attributable to the zincuric effect of captopril or to dietary measures, or both. Intraerythrocyte Zn was not significantly affected by antihypertensive treatment. Serum and intraerythrocyte concentrations of Mg were significantly lower (P < .001) in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, and serum Mg in patients treated with verapamil was significantly lower (P < .05) than after treatment with captopril or atenolol. Serum Mg concentration was related directly with serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.4043, P < .05). We conclude that supplementation with Mg may benefit patients with hypertension.}

The three treatment periods were amlodipine, doxazosin (study A) or enalapril (study B), and the combination of amlodipine with the second drug.\\ Each treatment was taken for 1 month, preceded by a 2-week single-blind run-in period, in which the patients received a low dose of doxazosin (study A) or enalapril (study B) to enable recruitment of patients with moderate or severe hypertension. Blood pressure, foot volume and plasma noradrenaline concentration were measured at the end of each run-in and treatment period.\\ The combination of alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism caused a fall in supine and erect blood pressures. These falls were significantly greater than on either drug alone, and greater than the sum of the falls when taking the individual drugs. The combination of amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor was also additive. Both combinations with amlodipine were tolerated well by all patients.\\ The combination of alpha-blockade and calcium antagonism has not previously been studied and should be useful for resistant hypertensives who have not tolerated beta-blockade or ACE inhibitors. The combination of ACE inhibition and calcium antagonism has previously been shown to be additive; its use as a positive control in the present studies suggests that the use of an active drug for a run-in period may be a useful design for permitting the study of patients from whom all treatment cannot safely be withdrawn.}

In these studies, headache (14.1%), upper respiratory infection (6.5%), dizziness (14.1%), asthenia/fatigue (3.8%), and cough (3.1%) were the clinical adverse experiences most often reported in patients treated with losartan. These adverse experiences were also frequently reported in patients receiving placebo: 17.2%, 5.6%, 2.4%, 3.9%, and 2.6%, respectively. Dry cough as an adverse event was reported in 8.8% of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and in 3.1% and 2.6% of patients treated with losartan or placebo, respectively. Only dizziness was considered "drug-related" more often in losartan-treated (2.4%) than placebo-treated (1.3%) patients. In controlled clinical trials, losartan was better tolerated than other antihypertensive agents as determined by the incidence of patients reporting any drug-related adverse experiences. Rates of discontinuation due to clinical adverse experiences in patients who received losartan monotherapy or losartan+hydrochlorothiazide were 2.3% and 2.8%, respectively, compared with placebo (3.7%). No laboratory adverse experiences were unexpected or of clinical importance. First-dose hypotension rarely occurred with losartan or with losartan plus hydrochlorothiazide, and withdrawal effects such as rebound hypertension were not observed in clinical trials. There were no clinically important differences in the clinical or laboratory safety profiles in the demographic subgroups for age, gender, or race. In controlled clinical trials, losartan demonstrated an excellent tolerability profile.}

   Abstract={Since the earlier review in Drugs substantial additional data have accumulated regarding the antihypertensive efficacy of isradipine in various clinical situations, as well as data on its clinical effects in atherosclerosis. Recent therapeutic trials confirm that the efficacy of isradipine in the treatment of patients with mainly mild to moderate hypertension, when administered orally as a conventional or modified release preparation, is similar to that of titrated dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa, metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of carotid artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased significantly less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of therapy. Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder of the 3-year trial. The confirmation of its antihypertensive efficacy, along with its favourable haemodynamic profile and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, preservation of quality of life and good tolerability, makes isradipine a suitable drug for the treatment of most patients with mild to moderate hypertension.}

As coprescription with diltiazem has not been previously studied, the objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of the addition of trimetazidine (60 mg/24 h) to diltiazem (180 mg/24 h) in the stable exertional angina insufficiently improved by calcium channel blocker alone. This multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted over a period of 6 months. The inclusion criteria were stable angina with electrically positive stress test, which remained positive despite a 15-day treatment with diltiazem (180 mg/24 h). It was conducted in 67 patients randomized into two groups: diltiazem-placebo (group I: 35 patients) and diltiazem-trimetazidine (group II: 32 patients). The follow-up consisted of clinical assessment and a stress test on inclusion and at 6 months. The two groups were similar on inclusion for all ergometric parameters, excepted for the time to onset of the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm and the total duration of effort, which were significantly longer in the placebo group. Comparison of the stress tests performed at the sixth month and on inclusion between groups I and II showed that the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm was significantly delayed by 2 minutes 41 seconds in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus 42 seconds in the placebo group (NS). Similarly, the work performed at this threshold was significantly increased by 1446 kpm in the trimetazidine group (p < 0.001) versus 564 kpm in the placebo group (p = 0.012). The difference between the two groups was significant for these two parameters, p = 0.008 and p = 0.018, respectively. At maximum effort, the total duration and the total work also increased significantly in the trimetazidine group, by 50 seconds (p = 0.006) and 570 kpm (p = 0.004), respectively, versus 16 seconds and 221 kpm in the placebo group (NS). The [double product (SBP x HR)/load (in watts)] ratio at the ischaemic threshold of 1 mm reached at M0, decreased significantly in the trimetazidine group by 69.9 (p < 0.001) versus 20.3 in the placebo group (NS). The difference between the two groups was significant (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

   Abstract={This is the first report of long-term use (one year) of isradipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, in the treatment of elderly patients with essential hypertension. Patients completing a three month, double-blind, multicentre study comparing isradipine to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were eligible to enroll in this open-label, continuation study. At initial baseline, patients were at least 60 years of age and had DBP from 95 mmHg to 120 mmHg. Patients were titrated when necessary every two weeks with isradipine, 5 mg to 15 mg once daily or 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily, to maintain sitting DBP < or = 90 mmHg. HCTZ, 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily, could be added for better BP control. A total of 136 patients completed the one year, open-label phase. One hundred and fourteen patients (84%) received isradipine as monotherapy (mean dose, 9.7 mg/day); 22 received concomitant HCTZ therapy at one year. Reduction in DBP was significant and similar among all age groups and races (mean change of -19 mmHg). Reduction in SBP was similar among all age groups. Ninety-four per cent of those receiving isradipine monotherapy achieved BP control during the last four months of treatment. Twenty-six patients (16%) withdrew from the study: 11 (7%) had adverse reactions (one with headache, two with pedal oedema, eight with other problems); 11 (7%) had nondrug-related problems; and in four (2%), the drugs were ineffective. Based on these observations, isradipine is a well-tolerated, safe and effective agent for long-term BP control in elderly patients with essential hypertension.}

   Abstract={A 14-week study was conducted in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a twice-daily sustained-release diltiazem preparation (120 or 180 mg) and once-daily enalapril (10 or 20 mg). Patients not achieving an adequate response after 6 weeks on monotherapy were given a combination therapy of twice-daily diltiazem 120 mg and once-daily enalapril 10 mg. Of the 147 patients admitted to the study, 70 received diltiazem and 77 received enalapril; 17 patients subsequently received combination therapy. Blood pressure reductions in patients completing 12 weeks of therapy were (sitting values): diltiazem 120 mg, 10.2/15.2 mmHg; diltiazem 180 mg, 19.1/14.7 mmHg; enalapril 10 mg, 25.7/17.5 mmHg; enalapril 20 mg, 19.6/14.0 mmHg; and combination therapy, 24.6/15.1 mmHg. No significant differences in the incidence level of individual symptoms were seen between the two groups: 34 (49%) in the diltiazem, 37 (48%) in the enalapril group; and, between weeks 6 and 12, 9 (53%) patients taking combination therapy. Two patients withdrew from the enalapril group and 8 from the diltiazem group. No unexpected side-effects were seen during the study and no deaths occurred in any treatment group. Twice-daily sustained-release diltiazem 120 or 180 mg was shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent and equal in efficacy and patient acceptability to once-daily enalapril 10 or 20 mg. Combination therapy effectively lowered blood pressure in patients in whom monotherapy was ineffective.}

   Abstract={Renal effects of mild hypertension and therapy have not been established. Since urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretions reflect renal effects of hypertension, they were related to blood pressure, other cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac target organ effects, and response to therapy in mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 85-99 mm Hg). Participants were from two clinics of the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS), a multicenter randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants received nutritional-hygienic therapy and one of five active drugs or placebo. Urinary albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretions were assessed prospectively using office "spot" collections from one clinic (n = 213) and retrospectively using overnight collections from the other clinic (n = 210). Relationships were determined between protein excretions and blood pressure, age, gender, race, blood glucose, cholesterol concentrations, and indices of body mass and left ventricular mass and function at baseline. Treatment effects were assessed after 3 to 12 months. Spot and overnight albumin excretions related positively to baseline systolic blood pressure by univariate analyses. Spot albumin excretion related positively to systolic blood pressure, age, creatinine clearance, and left ventricular function while overnight albumin excretion related positively to left ventricular mass and female gender by multiple regression analyses. Spot, but not overnight, albumin excretion declined significantly with active drug therapy. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase excretion did not relate to blood pressure or decline with therapy. The combined results suggest albumin excretion correlates with blood pressure, decreases with antihypertensive drug therapy, and is associated with greater left ventricular function and mass, as well as glomerular filtration rate, even at mild levels of hypertension.}

   Abstract={A new preparation of nifedipine for sublingual application in hypertensive urgencies was investigated in a prospective study. Patients admitted to the Emergency Department with a persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 190 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 100 mmHg received nifedipine 10 mg sublingual with a sprayer. A second dose was administrated fifteen minutes later if an adequate response defined as a stable reduction of SBP below 180 mmHg and DBP below 100 mmHg had not occurred. Of 30 patients, 21 (70%) responded to the first nifedipine application, 7 responded to the second dose, and 2 nonresponders had to be treated with urapidil. Overall mean SBP was 206 +/- 19 mmHg and mean DBP was 113 +/- 15 mmHg before treatment, and a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within fifteen minutes after nifedipine spray (p < 0.05). The maximum antihypertensive effect was for SBP in sixty minutes (146 +/- 19 mmHg) and for DBP after one hundred twenty minutes (78 +/- 18 mmHg). The average reduction in SBP was 29% and in DBP 31%. In first-dose responders (n = 21) a significant antihypertensive effect was noted within fifteen minutes. SBP declined from 205 +/- 21 to a minimum of 142 +/- 15 mmHg (22.3%) after sixty minutes and DBP from 113 +/- 13 to a minimum of 77 +/- 11 mmHg (22.2%) after one hundred twenty minutes.

   Abstract={The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study was initiated to determine the feasibility of a large trial in evaluating the effects of treatment of ischemia on outcome (mortality and myocardial infarction). The study was designed to examine the effects of medical treatment to control angina compared with treatment strategies guided by ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) ischemia or coronary anatomy.\\ Treatments to suppress ischemia (asymptomatic and symptomatic) have not been evaluated in a large prospective, randomized trial. Before undertaking such a trial, issues about recruitment and treatment strategies must be addressed.\\ The 618 enrolled patients had coronary artery disease suitable for revascularization, ischemia on stress test and asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory ECG. Patients were assigned randomly to one of three treatment strategies: 1) angina-guided medical strategy with titration of anti-ischemic medication to relieve angina (angina-guided strategy); 2) angina-guided plus ambulatory ECG ischemia-guided medical strategy with titration of anti-ischemic medication to eliminate both angina and ambulatory ECG ischemia (ischemia-guided strategy); and 3) revascularization by angioplasty or bypass surgery (revascularization strategy).\\ Ambulatory ECG ischemia was no longer present at the week 12 visit in 39% of patients assigned to the angina-guided strategy, 41% of patients assigned to the ischemia-guided strategy and 55% of patients assigned to the revascularization strategy. All strategies reduced the median number of episodes and total duration of ST segment depression during follow-up ambulatory ECG monitoring. Revascularization was the most effective strategy. Treadmill test results were concordant with those of ambulatory ECG monitoring. For most patients in the two medical strategies, angina was controlled with low to moderate doses of anti-ischemic medication, and the majority of patients (65%) in the revascularization strategy did not require medication for angina.\\ This pilot study demonstrated that cardiac ischemia can be suppressed in 40% to 55% of patients with either low or moderate doses of medication or revascularization and that a large trial is feasible.}

   Abstract={The primary objectives of the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot were 1) to compare the 12-week efficacy of three treatment strategies to suppress cardiac ischemia, and 2) to assess the feasibility of a prognosis trial in patients with asymptomatic cardiac ischemia.\\ Cardiac ischemia has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, most cardiac ischemia is asymptomatic, and although therapeutic strategies ranging from no medication to revascularization are being used to treat ischemia, no prospective study evaluating different treatment strategies has been reported.\\ Patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and ischemia on exercise and ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) in 11 clinical units were randomized to receive angina-guided medical therapy, angina-guided plus ambulatory ECG ischemia-guided medical therapy or revascularization (coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery). Patients were also randomized to receive either diltiazem plus isosorbide dinitrate or atenolol plus nifedipine when possible. After anti-ischemic medication adjustment to control angina, blinded medication was adjusted in the medical therapy groups to eliminate ischemia in the ischemia-guided group. The primary outcome was the absence of ischemia at 12 weeks. Follow-up was scheduled for 1 year.\\ A total of 1,959 patients were screened by ambulatory ECG monitoring; 982 (49%) had asymptomatic ischemia, and 618 (65%) were enrolled in the study. Most patients were men, were > 60 years old and had two or more ischemic episodes, early positive exercise tests and multivessel disease.\\ Design and baseline data for a pilot study of ischemia treatment strategies are described.}

   Abstract={Isradipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-entry blocker. Previous controlled and blinded trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of isradipine in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The purpose of this study was to reassess this safety and efficacy in a large number of patients in an open-label, long-term, multicenter trial. A total of 501 patients with essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg) received 5 to 10 mg/d of isradipine in two divided doses for a period of 32 weeks. The mean dose used was 7.4 mg/d with titration at week 4 from 5 mg/d (2.5 mg BID) to 10 mg/d (5 mg BID) if the diastolic pressure was still > 90 mm Hg. After 32 weeks of isradipine treatment, systolic blood pressure decreased from 154.9 +/- 16.4 mm Hg to 140.2 +/- 13.9 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and diastolic pressure from 101.2 +/- 5.2 mm Hg to 86.6 +/- 7.9 mm Hg (P < 0.001). This monotherapy was successful in reducing diastolic blood pressure > 10 mm Hg in 62.5% of the patients. Significant adverse effects were noted in 92 (18.4%) of the 501 patients; only 30 (6.0%) withdrew from the study because of adverse events. In this large, long-term, community-based study, isradipine was effective and well tolerated in most patients.}

The study was conducted in 121 patients with severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [BP] > 120 mm Hg, or systolic BP > 200 mm Hg). Patients were randomized to receive intravenous nicardipine or SNP. Drugs were administered according to a predetermined dosing schedule for a 10 to 12 h period. Sixty-one patients were randomized to intravenous nicardipine and 60 to SNP. Pretreatment BP values for the nicardipine and SNP groups were 217/128 mm Hg and 219/128 mm Hg, respectively. Therapeutic response (diastolic BP < 100 mm Hg, or a decrease of > 15 mm Hg; systolic BP < 180 mm Hg, or a decrease of > 20 mm Hg) was achieved in 98% (60/61) of patients treated with nicardipine and 93% (56/60) of patients treated with SNP. The mean decreases in systolic and diastolic BP were 61 mm Hg and 40 mm Hg after 4 h of nicardipine, and 59 mm Hg and 38 mm Hg after 4 h of SNP. The mean increases in heart rate also were similar in both groups (nicardipine, 12 beats/min; SNP 10 beats/min). The mean numbers of dose adjustments per hour required to maintain the BP reductions were lower (P < .01) in the nicardipine-treated patients (0.5 +/- 0.1 times per hour) than in the SNP-treated patients (1.5 +/- 0.2 times per hour).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

Fourteen patients withdrew from therapy; six patients withdrew because of adverse events (lisinopril, n = 3; diltiazem SR, n = 1) and lack of BP control (lisinopril, n = 1; diltiazem SR, n = 1). Both monotherapies were titrated upward (lisinopril 20-40 mg daily, diltiazem SR 120-180 mg twice daily) to achieve an office DBP < 90 mmHg. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 25 mg daily) was added to monotherapy after week 4 if patients did not reach the BP goal (i.e. non-responders). After four weeks of therapy, 72% of patients (74 of 103) were nonresponders. At eight weeks of therapy, 66 patients (lisinopril, n = 32; diltiazem SR, n = 34) had received HCTZ. At week 8, 53% of lisinopril and 36% of diltiazem SR patients met the response criteria. Mean office DBP decreased from baseline -18.1 +/- 8.6 mmHg for lisinopril patients and -15.9 +/- 10.1 mmHg for diltiazem SR patients at week 8. Lisinopril was as effective as diltiazem in reducing systolic and diastolic office BP at week 4 (p > 0.1). Likewise, at weeks 4 and 8, no statistically significant differences were detected between treatments (p > 0.05) for systolic and diastolic ambulatory BP averaged over 24 hours. Both treatments were well tolerated and showed important antihypertensive efficacy in patients with moderate to severe BP elevation.}

Amlodipine treatment did not appear to produce clinically significant changes in blood lipids; HCTZ, however, produced an increase in total plasma cholesterol (delta 22.9 +/- 8.6 mg/dl). The incidence of side effects and the rate of patient withdrawal in the amlodipine and HCTZ groups were comparable.

   Abstract={The effect of long-acting nicardipine tablets on diurnal variation of blood pressure was compared with that of standard nicardipine tablets and long-acting nifedipine tablets by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in 35 patients with hypertension. Long-acting nicardipine decreased systolic blood pressure in each age group, and there was no difference in its anti-hypertensive effect when compared with the other two drugs. All three drugs had no effect on the amplitude of daily blood pressure variation, and all three drugs decreased the baseline blood pressure in each age group when compared with untreated patients. In addition, no change was observed in the decrement of baseline blood pressure after switching from the other two drugs to long-acting nicardipine. Long-acting nicardipine had less effect on diurnal blood pressure variation than standard nicardipine tablets, which are administered three times daily. In each age group, long-acting nicardipine also more effectively inhibited the increase in cardiac work resulting from the morning rise phenomenon when compared with standard nicardipine tablets. These findings suggest that long-acting nicardipine may be a more useful preparation for the treatment of essential hypertension, particularly in elderly patients.}

   Abstract={Using a randomised double-blind crossover design with Latin square allocation of treatments in 20 subjects (7 male, 13 female-ages: 61-87 years) with systolic hypertension, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of once daily felodipine (extended release) 5-20 mg, enalapril 5-20 mg and their combination compared with placebo in four treatment phases each of 6 weeks duration. During each phase, doses were titrated to achieve a predose clinic supine systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or to a predetermined maximum dose. In both the felodipine and combination phases, predose supine and standing systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced compared with the placebo phase (decrease in supine pressure: -13/-5 and -18/-7, respectively). Only predose supine diastolic pressure was significantly reduced (-3 mmHg) compared to placebo in the enalapril phase. In combination the effects of the two drugs on predose blood pressure were additive. There was a 40-60% increase in reported symptoms in the felodipine and combination phases compared with the placebo and enalapril phases. Thus, in elderly subjects with systolic hypertension, felodipine effectively reduces blood pressure throughout the dose interval but with vasodilator adverse effects. In contrast, enalapril is well tolerated but is less effective in reducing blood pressure throughout the whole dose interval.}

The study employed a randomised double-blind crossover design with allocation of treatment order within subjects by Latin squares. For each subject, after a single-blind run-in placebo phase, there were four randomised treatment phases each of six weeks duration, with a dose titration step at three weeks if necessary. Twenty-eight subjects entered the randomised phases of the study and twenty-one completed all four phases--13 male, 8 female (ages: median 71, range 59-85 years). At the end of both the felodipine and metoprolol phases systolic and diastolic pressure were reduced at 2 hours postdose compared with the placebo phase (p < 0.001), the blood pressure reduction with felodipine (-40/-20 mmHg) being greater than that with metoprolol (-15/-9 mmHg) (p < 0.01). Immediately predose (12 hours postdose) there was a persisting reduction of supine systolic blood pressure (-17 mmHg) with felodipine (p < 0.001), but there was no significant effect of metoprolol. At both measurement times the two drugs when in combination had an additive effect on blood pressure. There was a 20% increase in reported symptoms during each of the active treatment phases. Four subjects withdrew during the randomised phases because of probable drug-related adverse events and six subjects required dosage reductions during the felodipine or combination phases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

The median increases in the time to onset of moderate angina at the final exercise tolerance test (end point) compared with baseline were 1.08 and 0.53 minutes for betaxolol and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.002, betaxolol and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.002, betaxolol vs placebo). The time to onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression increased significantly (p < 0.05) with betaxolol compared with placebo at all but 1 treatment time point (median increase [p = 0.001] 1.77 and 0.37 minutes, respectively, at end point). Duration of exercise also was increased significantly (p < 0.05) after the third week of treatment and at end point (median 0.62 and 0.50 minutes, respectively; p = 0.03). Generally comparable results were found within the diltiazem (n = 128) and nifedipine (n = 25) subgroups, although the nifedipine group was too small to detect statistically significant differences between betaxolol and placebo treatment. Resting systolic blood pressure, heart rate and the rate-pressure product, measured both when angina occurred and at the end of exercise, also were influenced significantly (p < 0.05) by the betaxolol addition. The only serious adverse effect associated with betaxolol treatment was syncope, seen in 2 patients.}

   Abstract={The pharmacological treatment, mainly based on diuretics, of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) has recently been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to compare the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of different drug regimens in elderly subjects with ISH (systolic blood pressure--SBP-- > or = 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure--DBP-- < 90 mmHg). A multicentre, randomized, controlled open trial was planned in the general practice setting. Four widely used treatment schedules were tested: hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride 2.5 mg (H+Am), nifedipine slow release 20 mg (N), atenolol 50 mg (At) and atenolol 25 mg plus chlorthalidone 6.25 mg (At+C). After a baseline evaluation, 308 patients (76.3% female, mean age 75.3 +/- 7.1 years) were randomized and followed up for 6 months. After 3 months the drug dosage was doubled if the systolic blood pressure goal (SBP < 160 mmHg and SBP reduction of at least 20 mmHg) had not been reached. Ninety-four subjects (30.5%) presented contraindications to beta-blockers. At the 3rd- and 6th-month visits all treatment groups, except At, showed a significant reduction in SBP compared to the control group; DBP showed no significant reduction in any group at any time. At the end of the follow-up the percentage of hypertensives who had reached the BP goal was 14.6% in the control group, 52.9% in H+Am, 54.8% in N, 28.6% in At and 52.2% in At+C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

Nifedipine was administered as capsules, nitrendipine was given from a small plastic tube (vial), containing 1 ml alcoholic solution. Every patient received in addition to the test medication a placebo corresponding to the other product. Patients with insufficient treatment after 45 min were given either an additional capsule of 10 mg nifedipine or a further vial containing 5 mg nitrendipine according to their group and maintaining the double dummy procedure.\\ Blood pressure and heart rate were measured repeatedly during 4 h, before and 90 min after beginning of the treatment a 12 channel resting ECG was recorded. At 45 min after administration the blood pressure had fallen significantly from 216.0/117.4 mmHg to 170.0/93.3 mmHg under nifedipine and from 216.9/117.3 mmHg to 177.4/94.4 mmHg under nitrendipine. 61.6% of the nifedipine patients and 58.8% of the nitrendipine patients had already reached blood pressure values < 180/100 mmHg after 45 min and in both groups 83% of these patients were still in this limit at the end of the observation period after 4 h. Tolerability was very good in both groups.\\ The new dosage form of nitrendipine (vial with 1 ml of alcoholic solution) represents an alternative in the treatment of hypertensive emergency.}

   Abstract={Lisinopril has been compared with slow-release nifedipine in a 16-week double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study involving 102 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced 6 and 5 mmHg more by lisinopril than by nifedipine over 12 weeks monotherapy. After 12 weeks a greater proportion of patients taking lisinopril was controlled (sitting diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg) than in those taking nifedipine. As a result, 17% of those taking lisinopril and 38% of those taking nifedipine required additional therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in similar response rates in the lisinopril and nifedipine groups (89% and 75% respectively). The rate of reporting of adverse events considered to be drug-related and the rate of withdrawals were similar for both treatments. Cough was more often reported with lisinopril and headache, sweating, and hot flushes with nifedipine. We conclude that once-daily titrated doses of lisinopril produced better control of blood pressure than twice-daily titrated doses of nifedipine.}

   Abstract={Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias, leading at least in a subset of patients to severe symptoms (palpitations, weakness, syncope), and to hemodynamic impairment especially in the clinical setting of left ventricular dysfunction. Thus, in many cases restauration of sinus rhythm is indicated because of the negative effects of reduced cardiac output. Quinidine has been the first line drug for many years and has been proven to be highly effective especially when combined with Verapamil. But there is growing concern about using quinidine and other class I-anti-arrhythmic agents because of some hints in clinical trials for increased longterm mortality on these drugs. This study was undertaken to test the efficacy of Sotalol, a beta-blocker with additional strong class-III antiarrhythmic action, compared to a fixed combination of Quinidine and Verapamil for conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and maintenance of sinus rhythm after medical or electrical cardioversion. To avoid early proarrhythmic effects, potassium values in the range of "high"-normal values (> 4.3 mval/L) were tried to be obtained. 82 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Sotalol or Quinidine/Verapamil. There was no difference between the groups as far as the underlying heart disease, duration of atrial fibrillation (mean 219 days) and other clinical features including echocardiographic parameters were concerned. The dose of the drug was weight-related individually adjusted, and the drug was continued thereafter. If sinus rhythm could not be established at that time, electric cardioversion was performed and the drug was continued in lower dosage thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

   Abstract={Placebo has only a slight effect on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). Some authors have suggested that the use of a placebo is not necessary in a study on the drugs effect on ABP. We demonstrate that even if placebo effect is small, the use of a placebo group is still necessary. Effects of one daily dose of 50 mg atenolol + 20 mg slow-released nifedipine (AN) were investigated. Patients with office DBP 90-110 mmHg received, in a double-blind protocol, either AN (group AN, n = 31) or a placebo (group P, n = 26). Ambulatory BP (ABP) and HR were measured (Spacelabs or Diasys systems) for 24 h before and one month after treatment. The 2 groups were comparable before treatment. After 1 month under treatment, ABP was significantly lower in the AN group, compared to the P group, and this over the whole day (p = 0.03 to p < 0.0001). The effect was the most important between 10-17 h (p < 0.0001). HR was significantly lower in the AN group during daytime (6-22 h), but not during the night (22-6 h). Over the whole group, placebo effect was not significant. However, ABP did decrease under placebo in subjects with high initial pressure. As a result, an analysis without data from the placebo group led to an overestimation of the effects of the drug.}

   Abstract={Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a severe eruption which is usually drug related. If the causative drug is discontinued, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis resolves spontaneously in ten days. The aim of this study was to compare drugs suspected of causing acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis reported to French Pharmacovigilance centres and those reported in the literature.\\ All cases of "pustular eruption" qualified as "serious" reported to the French Pharmacovigilance Centers between January 1985 and December 2001 were analyzed. Cases for which the diagnosis of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis was not clearly identified were reviewed by a dermatologist. The relationship between acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and drug exposure was re-examined by one of us. An exhaustive review of the literature was also performed.\\ Review of the data base revealed 207 cases of serious acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis leading to death in 4 cases (2%). Of these cases of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, only one drug was suspected in 107 cases (51.6%). The main drugs involved were: pristinamycin (18 cases), amoxicillin (+/- clavulanic acid) (16 cases), hydroxychloroquine (8 cases) and a combination of spiramycin + metronidazole (5 cases).\\ The most frequent causal drugs in our study and in the literature are: amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid, pristinamycin, hydroxychloroquine, ampicillin, diltiazem, co-trimoxazole, terbinafine, carbamazepine and spiramycin +/- metronidazole. Only pristinamycin and diltiazem have information in their summary of product characteristics regarding the risk of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Because it is essential to discontinue the causative drug as soon as possible if a pustular eruption occurs, physicians must be informed of the risk, which should be added to the "adverse events", and "warnings" sections of the summary of product characteristics of the drugs concerned.\\ Our results show the relevance of notification of side effects by physicians to pharmacovigilance centres, leading to the identification of a signal and public health dissemination of warnings.}

Treatment was titrated to achieve a 20% lowering of blood pressure (BP).\\ Maternal BP and heart rate were measured at inclusion and repeatedly during the first hour following the drugs administration. Fetal heart rate was recorded throughout the study period. The main outcome endpoints were the success rate and the length of time needed to achieve the therapeutic goal. The rate of maternal and fetal adverse events and dose adjustments were also analyzed.\\ Labetalol and nicardipine achieved the 20% lowering in BP in the same proportion (63% and 70% success rates, respectively). Overall nicardipine caused a significantly greater decrease in systolic and diastolic BP. No patient had any episode of hypotension. The length of time to achieve the BP goal was also similar (12 vs. 11 min, respectively). Both drugs were well tolerated except for a moderate tachycardia observed with the use of nicardipine.\\ Nicardipine and labetalol are effective and safe in the initial treatment of severe hypertension of pregnancy.}

   Abstract={Impaired renal function occurs in about 50% of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of endstage renal disease. Reduction of blood pressure to levels around 120/80 mmHg is one of the most effective way to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy. Recent meta-analyses, however, have emphasized on the fact that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP-CCB) exert nephro-protective effects which go beyond the effect of blood pressure reduction. This has lately been confirmed by a prospective trial in comparison to the betablocker atenolol. Based on these data, demographics of the Swiss population, literature data on mortality rates of type 2 diabetics with impaired renal function and studies on true costs of antihypertensives, we calculated the costs of a longterm intervention (20 years) with antihypertensives in 3536 middle-aged Swiss patients with type 2 diabetes and macro-albuminuria whose antihypertensive regimen was based either on the ACEI lisinopril, or the ND-HP-CCB verapamil, or the betablocker atenolol. Under atenolol, acquisition costs were lowest, whereas faster loss of renal function over time increased mortality rate and thus reduced the number of patients to be treated. Nevertheless, due to the fact that patients reached uremia and had to be dialyzed, 20 years of atenolol-based regimen with costs of 316 millions of Swiss francs turned out to be much more expensive than the lisinopril- or the verapamil-based regimen with 121 and 38 millions of Swiss francs, respectively. Thus, low acquisition cost is not necessarily the only important determinant of overall costs of drug therapy.}

A teratologic effect has been observed during early pregnancy at supratherapeutic dosage. At usual therapeutic dosage, no fetal abnormalities have been observed. The efficacy of CBs for tocolysis is superior to that of beta-adrenergic drugs and allows a reduction of neonatal morbidity.

Following initial control, 12 nicardipine- and 24 nitroprusside-treated patients required additional titration of their infusions to maintain blood pressure within the targeted range (p < 0.05). No patient suffered a stroke, myocardial infarction, or was returned to the operating room (OR) for bleeding.\\ Nicardipine administration produced more rapid BP control, most likely related to the administration of a loading dose. In addition to more rapid control, nicardipine-treated patients had less variability in BP and required significantly fewer additional interventions. Although no patient suffered a major event during this study, this study was not powered sufficiently to assess safety.}

The treatment duration was 8 weeks in both groups. Quadropril was given in a fixed dose of 6 mg once daily. The initial dose of amlodipine was 5 mg/day. In case of insufficient effect the dose was elevated to 10 mg/day. The efficacy was evaluated by changes in blood pressure (BP) measured at rest. Moreover, in 50 randomly chosen patients 24-h monitoring of BP was performed at the start and end of the treatment.\\ In the quadropril group baseline systolic BP reached 158.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, diastolic BP--101.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, heart rate was 74.3 +/- 1.6 beats/min. In the amlodipine group baseline systolic BP was 159.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, diastolic BP--101.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, heart rate was 71.3 +/- 1.0 beats/min. Systolic BP decreased at the end of quadropril therapy to 138.5 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, diastolic BP to 88.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg. No significant change of the heart rate was observed. Under 5 mg of amlodipine systolic BP decreased to 137.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg and diastolic BP to 87.1 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Heart rate increased to 73.3 +/- 2.2 beats/min. Under therapy with 10 mg amlodipine systolic BP decreased to 145.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg, diastolic BP to 89.7 +/- 3.4 mm Hg. Heart rate increased to 77.3 +/- 4.0 beats/min (p < 0.01). The hypotensive effect of quadropril remained stable while the effect of amlodipine decreased by the 8th week of therapy (p < 0.01). Side effects were observed significantly more often in the amlodipine group, then in the quadropril group. The main quadropril side effect was cough. Side effects observed in the amlodipine group were edemas, tachycardia, weakness.\\ Both quadropril and amlodipine demonstrated a comparable antihypertensive effect although in 11 of 40 patients in the amlodipine group a dose increase was necessary and tolerability of quadropril was better.}

In addition, there was a reduction of the double-product, especially in the morning and 68% of the patients didn't have any adverse events.\\ The therapy verapamil COER-24 180/240 mg in a single dose is useful for mild and moderate hypertensive patients, with significant pressure decrease in both office blood pressure measurements and in the ABPM/24 hours, as well as showing good tolerability.}

   Abstract={Nicardipine is a calcium antagonist which in previous trials has been shown to be effective in the prevention of stroke and the treatment of its sequelae, such as cognitive deterioration of vascular origin. We consider a phase IV study at primary care level to analyze the tolerability and efficacy of a retarded action formulation of 40 mg nicardipine.\\ In this open, prospective, multicentric trial 6,375 patients took part, of whom 5,593 were evaluated (87.7%). All were diagnosed as having vascular-type dementia (Hachinski > 6) and were given treatment with nicardipine retard (40 mg/day/6 months). The patients were assessed on the Montorio (daily activity) and SPMSQ (cognitive function) scales at the first visit and after one, three and six months, together with a record of side effects.\\ Only 0.9% of the patients recruited abandoned the study for problems of tolerability of the drug. The average improvement seen on Montorio's test was statistically significant from the first month, and reached 9% after six months. The 65.5% of the patients who started the study in seriously deteriorated condition showed improvement after six months. For the SPMSQ test, the average improvement was also statistically significant from the first visit and over 40% after six months. There was improvement in 64.4% of the patients who were severely deteriorated at the start of the study.\\ Nicardipine retard is a drug which is safe and effective when used for the treatment of mental deterioration of vascular origin.}

   Abstract={Diltiazem reduces non-fatal reinfarction and refractory ischaemia after non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, an acute coronary syndrome similar to the incomplete infarction that occurs after successful reperfusion. We postulated that this agent would reduce cardiac events in patients after acute myocardial infarction treated initially with thrombolytic agents-a clinical application previously unexplored with heart-rate-lowering calcium antagonists.\\ A prospective, randomised, double-blind, sequential trial was done in 874 patients with acute myocardial infarction, but without congestive heart failure, who first received thrombolytic agents. Patients received either 300 mg oral diltiazem once daily, or placebo, initiated within 36-96 h of infarct onset, and given for up to 6 months. The trial primary endpoint was the cumulative first event rate of cardiac death, non-fatal reinfarction, or refractory ischaemia. Additional prespecified endpoints included several composites of non-fatal cardiac events (non-fatal reinfarction combined with refractory ischaemia, all recurrent ischaemia, or the need for myocardial revascularisation). The diagnosis of ischaemia, whether refractory or recurrent, and the need for myocardial revascularisation, was always based on objective electrocardiographical evidence of ischaemia, either at rest or on exertion.\\ For the trial primary endpoint, 131 events occurred in the 444 placebo patients and 97 events in the 430 diltiazem patients (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02; p=0.07). For non-fatal cardiac events, diltiazem treatment was associated with a relative decrease (0.76; 0.58-1.00) in the combined event rate of non-fatal reinfarction and refractory ischaemia. There was a similar decrease in the composite non-fatal endpoints of non-fatal reinfarction combined with all recurrent ischaemia (0.80; 0.64-1.00) and non-fatal reinfarction combined with the need for myocardial revascularisation (0.67; 0.46-0.96). The need for myocardial revascularisation alone was significantly reduced by 42% (0.61; 0.39-0.96). No major safety issues were encountered.\\ Diltiazem did not reduce the cumulative occurrence of cardiac death, non-fatal reinfarction, or refractory ischaemia during a 6-month follow-up, but did reduce all composite endpoints of non-fatal cardiac events, especially the need for myocardial revascularisation.}

   Abstract={Comparison of the hypotensive effects of lomir (isradipine) and adalat (nifedipine) in 36 patients showed lomir to be more effective after aortocoronary bypass surgery. Normalization of arterial pressure started 5-10 min after lomir infusion, followed by a 24.5% increase in cardiac output and decrease in peripheral vascular resistance by 43.8%. Arterial pressure did not rise after lomir infusion was discontinued. With adalat, arterial pressure normalized 30 min later, and the therapeutic effect was achieved with a very high dose (5-7 times higher than recommended). Cardiac output did not change, and cardiac arrhythmias were observed in 11.7% patients. Therefore, lomir is a preferable Ca channel blocker for treating postoperative arterial hypertension after aortocoronary bypass surgery.}

   Abstract={The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely. Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events. However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events. A randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled multicenter trial with 1000 patients to be recruited was designed to compare the effects of two antiarrhythmic drugs frequently used in Germany for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, Sotalol and the fixed combination of chinidin and verapamil (Cordichin). Patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter will be observed for a period of one year. The occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is documented by transtelephonic ECG monitoring. Patients with document an ECG once daily, and recording is mandatory in case of symptoms. ECGs are transmitted to a central data base for analysis. This clinical trial is designed to answer the following questions: (1) What is the average rate of spontaneous events of symptomatic atrial fibrillation? (2) Is it possible to reduce the frequency of symptomatic events by chronic antiarrhythmic drug administration? (3) What is the long-term frequency for the occurrence of severe side-effects under antiarrhythmic medication? The primary endpoint is defined as the time to first recurrence of symptomatic arrhythmia after reaching steady-state plasma concentrations of the study medication. The trial started in November 1997 and is planned to be finished by the end of 1999.}

   Abstract={The TEAM trial investigated the effectiveness and tolerance of a fixed combination of the ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker (2 mg trandolapril and 180 mg verapamil retard) (preparation Tarka) in an open multicentre prospective study of treatment of moderately severe hypertension (diastolic pressure at the end of the two-week wash-out period 100-115 mm Hg). The trial comprised 163 patients who were treated first for four weeks by a monotherapy with 2 mg trandolapril. After these four weeks patients who attained normal blood pressure proceeded with trandolapril treatment. Hypertensive patients who did not attain normal diastolic pressure levels were treated for another four weeks by a fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR. After four weeks of treatment with trandolapril 62 patients of 163 (37%) had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. The fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR reduced the diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 71.6% of the patients resistant to treatment with 2 mg trandolapril and in another 15.6% of patients it reduced the diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg or more. After two months of treatment 60 patients had a normal blood pressure due to trandolapril (37%) and another 73 patients (45%) treated by a combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR, i.e. a total of 133 patients (82%) who originally suffered from moderately severe hypertension, attained a normal diastolic blood pressure. The mean decrease of diastolic pressure after two months of treatment was 19.5 mm Hg in "non-respondents" to trandolapril monotherapy and 23.6 mm Hg in "respondents". The mean decrease of systolic pressure in "non-respondents" and "respondents" after trandolapril treatment was 19.5 mm Hg and 35.0 mm Hg resp. The fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil was not only effective but was associated with a minimum of undesirable effects. The incidence of headaches declined significantly. The combination of the above preparations is useful also because both preparations have a cardio- and nephroprotective effect and do not affect the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Treatment with a fixed combination of trandolapril and verapamil SR is indicated in moderately severe hypertension not responding to monotherapy, in particular when associated with diabetes, hyperlipoproteinaemia, ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular hypertrophy.}

   Abstract={Essential hypertension is a major Public Health issue. Although the number of treated hypertensive patients has increased, only 25% of treated patients have their blood pressure levels under control. The benefit of treating hypertension has been proven, but cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates remain high. The ideal antihypertensive drug should not only normalize blood pressure levels, but also reduce the associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. The role of angiotensin II in systemic hypertension and its complications has been recently redefined. The potent trophic effects of angiotensin II on blood vessels and on cardiac cells have been well demonstrated, especially the role of angiotensin II in left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, and congestive heart failure. Of all ongoing mortality and morbidity trials in systemic hypertension, VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation) is the only one comparing an angiotensin II antagonist (valsartan) with a third-generation calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). The main hypothesis of the VALUE trial is that, for an equivalent decrease in blood pressure, valsartan will be more effective than amlodipine in decreasing cardiac mortality and morbidity. VALUE is a prospective, multinational, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison with a response-dependent dose titration scheme. VALUE involves 14,400 patients in over 30 countries, who will be followed for 4 years or until 1450 patients experience a primary endpoint. The population to be included in VALUE consists of hypertensive men and women, aged 50 years or older, and at a relatively high risk of sustaining a cardiovascular event. The high risk profile is defined taking into account age, gender, and a list of cardiovascular risk factors and disease factors. Risk factors are cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, uncomplicated left ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, and high serum creatinine. Disease factors include documented history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy with strain on the ECG. A unique feature of VALUE is the assessment of the predictive power of this cardiovascular risk factor scale in a large population of treated hypertensive patients. The trial started on 10 September 1997.}

   Abstract={Therapy of detrusor hyperactivity with anticholinergic agents often is followed by adverse drug reactions. Intravesical application may be an interesting alternative. A randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, mono-centre clinical trial was carried out in 84 patients with urgency or urge incontinence. Due to intravesical administration of oxybutynin (CAS 5633-20-5) (n = 21) and trospium chloride (CAS 10405-02-4) (n = 21), respectively, a significant increase in maximum bladder capacity and decrease of detrusor pressure accompanied by an increase of residual urine were found in comparison to placebo in urodynamical investigations. Improvement of uninhibited bladder contractions occurred leading to higher filling volume. Under verapamil (CAS 152-11-4) (n = 21) no marked changes in the efficacy variables were found compared with placebo. All patients completed the study and were assessed with regard to efficacy and safety. No adverse events or marked changes in the vital signs were reported. The immediate onset of effect and the lack of adverse drug reactions suggest that treatment with topical oxybutynin or trospium chloride is an effective alternative in patients with intolerable side effects when orally treated. In addition, intravesical administration may be indicated in patients with bladder spasms due to indwelling catheter or in order to increase bladder capacity before percutaneous cystostomy.}

   Abstract={The efficacy of amlodipine (AML) was tested in hypertensive cats in a placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trial. Five cats were randomized to receive 0.625 mg AML once daily and 4 cats to receive placebo (PLA) once daily. The average systolic blood pressure (SBP) recorded by the Doppler method on day 0 was 212 +/- 21 mm Hg in the AML group and 216 +/- 32 mm Hg in the PLA group. On day 7, the cats receiving AML had a significantly lower average daily SBP (160 +/- 30 mm Hg) but SBP in the PLA group was unchanged (207 +/- 31 mm Hg). On day 7, all cats receiving PLA and one cat receiving AML were crossed over to the other group because of inadequate response. Blood pressure did not decrease adequately in 3 cats by day 14 (7 days of PLA and 7 days AML) and the treatment code was broken. Each of these cats was subsequently administered 1.25 mg AML daily. Cats requiring 1.25 mg AML once daily (6.1 kg +/- 0.7 kg) weighed significantly more than cats that responded to 0.625 mg AML once daily (4.1 +/- 0.7 kg). The average daily SBP recorded in the 6 cats that completed the study was significantly lower after 16 weeks of treatment (152 +/- 14 mm Hg) compared to day 0 (221 +/- 24 mm Hg). Three cats were euthanized before completion of the study. All 3 cats were responders to AML on day 7. SBPs measured 24 hours after AML administration were similar to the average daily SBP, suggesting that AML effectively controlled SBP for a 24-hour period. AML was shown to be an effective once-daily antihypertensive agent when administered to cats at a dosage of 0.18 +/- 0.03 mg/kg sid.}

   Abstract={Bepridil (Cordium) is a calcium channel blocker which has been demonstrated to be effective in the preventive treatment of angina. Few controlled trials have compared bepridil to diltiazem (Tildiem), the reference calcium channel blocker. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bepridil in stable coronary patients. 148 patients (139 M, 9 F, mean age: 58 +/- 8.6 years), with documented coronary artery disease and positive stress test after 5 days of placebo were included. After double-blind randomization, they received bepridil (300 mg/day ion 3 doses), or diltiazem (180 mg+/day in 3 doses) for 15 days. A stress test was then performed under the same conditions as on inclusion. The anti-ischaemic efficacy of the two drugs was comparable. Total work increased from 4,552.4 +/- 2,179.4 Kpm a 6,103.2 +/- 2,849.2 Kpm with bepridil (p < or = 0.0001) and from 4,524.8 +/- 2,160.5 Kpm a 5,848.3 +/- 2,800.3 Kpm (p < or = 0.0001) with diltiazem, with no intergroup difference. Duration of effort was significantly prolonged: from 10.5 +/- 3.0 min to 12.5 +/- 3.3 min with bepridil (p < or = 0.0001) and from 10.5 +/- 2.9 min to 12.1 +/- 3.4 min with diltiazem (p < or = 0.0001), with no intergroup difference. The time to onset of 1 min of ST depression increased significantly between the two stress tests, from 8.36 +/- 2.7 min to 10.82 +/- 3.4 min with bepridil (p < or = 0.001) and from 8.02 +/- 3.0 min to 10.53 +/- 3.6 min with diltiazem (p < or = 0.001), with no significant difference between the two groups. The clinical safety of the two products was comparable. On the electrocardiogram, the QT interval was significantly prolonged with bepridil, from 368.6 +/- 37.5 msec to 393.6 +/- 38.7 msec (p < or = 0.0001), reflecting cellular impregnation of the drug.}

   Abstract={Diltiazem reduces the cyclosporine dose required for blood levels in the therapeutic target range by 30 to 40%. The effect of diltiazem on the pharmacokinetic disposition of cyclosporine after oral Neoral application is unknown and it is unclear whether or not the diltiazem-cyclosporine interaction is affected by the galenic cyclosporine formulation.\\ Fifty-one stable renal allograft patients (19 females, 32 males) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized and double-blind study. The patients were assigned to 3 treatment groups: with diltiazem (I, n = 17), with nifedipine (II, n = 17) and without calcium channel blockers (III, n = 17). Nine patients in each group received Sandimmun and 8 patients Neoral. Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and its metabolites AM1 and AM9 were measured using HPLC for 12 weeks. The 3 treatment groups were not different in respect to age, gender distribution and serum creatinine concentration. Cyclosporine doses were adjusted on basis of the blood levels.\\ The cyclosporine doses required to achieve target blood levels were significantly lower in group I compared with group II (-43%) and group III (-33%; p < 0.0001). Although the cyclosporine blood concentrations in all groups were in the therapeutic range, the blood levels in group I showed a much lower variability. The blood concentrations of the metabolite AM1 in group I were significantly higher than those in groups II and III after dose correction (p < 0.0001), those of AM9 were significantly lower in group I than in groups II and III (p < 0.0001). The average dose, and the blood concentration of cyclosporine was not different when patients receiving Neoral were compared with those receiving Sandimmun within the groups. In the patients in group I, the blood concentration of metabolite AM1 was significantly higher after Sandimmun application than after Neoral. No other differences in the metabolite concentrations were detected within the groups comparing patients taking Sandimmun or Neoral. The incidences of acute rejection were lower in group I (17.6%) than in the other groups (II: 52.9%; III: 41%).\\ Diltiazem significantly reduced the necessary dose of cyclosporine. Compared with groups II and III, the blood concentrations were more stable in patients in group I. Diltiazem increased the blood concentration of AM1 in patients treated with Sandimmun to a larger extent than in patients taking Neoral. No additional pharmacokinetic differences of the 2 cyclosporine applications different with Sandimmun or Neoral were found.}

   Abstract={We examined the antihypertensive efficacy of: (1) sublingual-oral single doses of captopril (25 mg) and nifedipine-capsules (10 mg) in 9 + 9 white patients and in 9 + 8 black patients with hypertensive crisis; and (2) a single oral dose of the slow-acting preparation of nifedipine-retard (20 mg) in another 10 black patients. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed at 10 min intervals for 6 h after administration. After 6 h, the BP falls induced by these drugs were still significantly lower than the baseline placebo values. Hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was established more rapidly than that of captopril in both white and black patients, and of nifedipine-retard in black patients. Considering the area under the curve of BP values during the 6-h treatment, the overall hypotensive effect of nifedipine-capsules was similar to captopril in white patients, but significantly more pronounced than captopril and nifedipine-retard in black patients. In white patients similar maximal drops of BP (mean+/-s.e.m.) were obtained with nifedipine-capsules (71+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) and with captopril (69+/-4/50+/-3 mm Hg). In black patients the maximal drop of BP of nifedipine-capsules (70+/-4/52+/-4 mm Hg) was greater (P < 0.02) than that of captopril (48+/-4/32+/-3 mm Hg) but similar to that of nifedipine-retard (71+/-4/49+/-4 mm Hg). However, in contrast to nifedipine-capsules and captopril, nifedipine-retard produced a slower drop in BP. The time of peak drop in BP of both nifedipine-capsules and captopril occurred within the first 2 h whereas with nifedipine-retard it occurred only between 4 and 6 h after administration. Fewer patients reported side effects with nifedipine-retard as compared with the other two preparations. We conclude that single doses of captopril and nifedipine reduces BP for at least 6 h in both white and black patients with hypertensive crisis, but nifedipine is more potent than captopril in black patients. The slow release form of nifedipine-retard effectively and safely lowers BP while achieving a rapid enough effect without the critical rapid falls in BP that occur with nifedipine-capsules.}

   Abstract={Short-acting calcium antagonists have a deleterious effect on the prognosis for patients with myocardial ischemia, possibly caused by overactivation of sympathetic nerves due to vasodilatation, negative inotropism, or coronary steal. However, there is considerable debate about whether long-acting calcium antagonists as well as the short-acting calcium antagonists have the same effect. Barnidipine-HCl is a newly-developed calcium antagonist with 1:2 short- and long-acting particles. This study evaluated the changes of autonomic tone due to barnidipine. Both the short- and long-acting effect of the calcium antagonist was evaluated. Eleven patients with primary hypertension underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring before and after the treatment with barnidipine. Heart rate and blood pressure were compared before and after the medication. Heart rate variability was analyzed with a Marquette 8000/T. High frequency power (HF), as a parameter of vagal tone, and the ratio to low frequency power (LF), as a parameter of sympathetic tone, were obtained. Twenty-four-hour average blood pressure decreased significantly during the day, but nocturnal hypotension was not observed. Heart rate did not increase. HF decreased at the peak of the short- and long-acting components. LF/HF increased at the peak of the short-acting component. Short-acting particles of barnidipine had a deleterious effect on the autonomic tone, that is overactivation of sympathetic tone and suppression of vagal tone. Long-acting particles of barnidipine suppressed the vagal tone. These findings suggest that short-acting calcium antagonists may cause arrhythmia or deterioration of coronary ischemia.}

   Abstract={The administration of calcium antagonists to patients with healed myocardial infarction is a controversial treatment. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem on cardiac events in patients with healed myocardial infarction.\\ A controlled clinical open trial of 1115 patients with healed myocardial infarction was carried out between 1986 and 1994. The patients included 595 who received no calcium antagonist, 341 who received short-acting nifedipine 30 mg/d, and 179 who received short-acting diltiazem 90 mg/d. The primary end points were cardiac events, which were defined as fatal or nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction; death from congestive heart failure; sudden death; and hospitalization because of worsening angina, congestive heart failure, or premature ventricular contractions. Cardiac events occurred in 51 patients (8.6%) in the no-calcium-antagonist group and 54 (10.4%) in the calcium-antagonist group (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.85), demonstrating that the calcium antagonists did not reduce the incidence of cardiac events. Subgroup analysis revealed no beneficial effects of these drugs for reducing cardiac events in patients with such complications as hypertension or angina pectoris.\\ This study showed that use of short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem in this postmyocardial infarction population was associated with a 24% higher cardiac event rate, but this strong adverse trend did not reach statistical significance.}

   Abstract={The effects of bisoprolol on transient myocardial ischemia have been compared with those of nifedipine in patients with coronary artery disease in end-stage renal failure maintained on haemodialysis. We also evaluated the tolerability of both drugs. Sixty patients (42 males, 18 females, mean age 52 +/- 4 years) in renal failure maintained on haemodialysis, with coronary artery disease and more than four significant episodes of transient myocardial ischemia (> or = 1 min) during 48-hour Holter monitoring, were included in the study. All cardiovascular drugs were discontinued > or = 6 days before this 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, with the exception of sublingual nitrates allowed for relief of anginal attacks. Patients were then randomized to receive either bisoprolol or nifedipine for 2 weeks. After a 15-day wash-out period, they were crossed over to receive either bisoprolol or nifedipine for other 2 weeks. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student's t test. A p value < 0.01 was considered significant. Both bisoprolol and nifedipine reduced number and duration of transient ischemic episodes as well as the total ischemic burden. Reductions were statistically significant for both antianginal drugs. Only bisoprolol was effective in silent ischemia (p < 0.001). It also reduced heart rate (p < 0.001), while nifedipine raised it (p < 0.001). Both drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The circadian variations of transient ischemic episodes showed two peaks in the 24 hours. Both peaks were reduced with bisoprolol. Nifedipine brought a clear overall reduction in the number of episodes but the circadian pattern was unchanged. During the study, 10 patients taking bisoprolol and 12 patients taking nifedipine had drug adverse effects. No one of them had to be withdrawn from treatment. In conclusion, bisoprolol seems to be more useful than nifedipine because its effects, in transient ischemic episodes, are greatly superior to those of nifedipine, and because it is effective also in silent ischemia. Both drugs showed a good tolerability in these patients. Bisoprolol, reducing the two daily peaks of ischemic episodes frequency, has a protective role towards mortality due to coronary artery disease.}

   Abstract={beta-Blockers are known to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy by lowering arterial pressure. Moreover, in individuals with diabetic nephropathy, antihypertensive agents that provide sustained reductions in proteinuria slow the rate of decline in renal function compared with agents without this antiproteinuric effect. To examine whether differential effects on proteinuria affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we conducted a randomized study that compared the effects of a heart rate-lowering calcium channel blocker, sustained-release verapamil, with those of a beta-blocker, atenolol, on the progression of diabetic renal disease. The primary end point of the study was a change in creatinine clearance slope. Thirty-four African Americans with the following inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups: serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL, proteinuria greater than 1500 mg/d, longer than a 5-year history of both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and exclusion of other renal diseases. Goal blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg. All subjects received loop diuretics as second line agents to help achieve the blood pressure goal. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein and sodium excretions as well as creatinine clearance were measured at 6-month intervals. Blood pressure was measured every 3 months. After a mean follow-up of 54+/-6 months, the calcium channel blocker group demonstrated both a slower rate of decline in creatinine clearance (-1.7+/-0.9 versus -3.7+/-1.4 mL/min per year per 1.73 m2, P<.01) and a greater reduction in proteinuria compared with the atenolol group. Additionally, a greater proportion of the atenolol group had a 50% or more increase in serum creatinine compared with the verapamil group (32+/-9% versus 16+/-7%, P<.05). These between-group differences could not be explained by differences in blood pressure control. These data support the concept that antihypertensive agents that persistently maintain reductions in both arterial pressure and proteinuria slow the progression of diabetic renal disease in African Americans to a greater extent than those agents without these effects.}

   Abstract={Calcium antagonists are widely used in therapy of hypertension and angina pectoris. Their advantage is good efficacy, relatively few and not dangerous side effects and first of all lack of bad metabolic effects (hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipoproteinemia). In contrast to beta-blockers and diuretics, which decline mortality from myocardial infarctions and strokes there are not similar information concerning calcium antagonists. Two meta-analysis from 1995 unexpectedly suggest, that some preparations of calcium antagonists increase mortality from myocardial infarctions and strokes. In our paper we discuss possible pathogenetic (harmful) mechanisms, pay attention to each class of calcium antagonists and time of action of the particular drugs. Short acting nifedipine formulation should be withdrawn from chronic hypertension and angina pectoris therapy. Ongoing multicenter trials in several European countries and in USA will decide the usefulness of other calcium antagonists preparations.}

Secondary endpoints included exercise-induced ischaemia, left ventricular function measured by Doppler echocardiography, adverse cardiac events and clinical outcome.\\ Patients had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction between 25 and 50%, but no heart failure. Exercise time was not different in the two groups. Nisoldipine-CC prolonged time to 1 mm ST deviation (P = 0.03). There was an effect of nisoldipine-CC of +3.6 cm.s-1 on early peak velocity (P = 0.01) and of -6.2 ms on isovolumic relaxation time (P = 0.005), but no effects on left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction. There was a trend towards reduced mortality (one death in the nisoldipine-CC group vs seven in the placebo group. P < 0.07) and the combined end-point of mortality and cardiac events (P = 0.09). Peripheral oedema occurred in 49 patients assigned to nisoldipine-CC and two assigned to placebo (P < 0.001). There were no differences in non-cardiac events.\\ Nisoldipine-CC did not improve exercise time but increased time to 1 mm ST deviation, and improved diastolic left ventricular function. It is safe and well tolerated in post-infarction patients with impaired left ventricular function.}

   Abstract={Recent advances in knowledge about calcium's role as an intracellular regulator allow to broaden understanding of possible pathophysiologic mechanisms in affective disorders. An hypothesis emerge that bipolar illness arise from disorders in calcium-regulated functions. Given this hypothesis, some authors propose to describe the common profiles of action of the different mood-stabilizers: all the neural mechanisms that are hypothesized to explain various psychopharmacological treatments of bipolar illness involve functions that are critically controlled by calcium. Moreover, in every instance, a known action of lithium on calcium-dependent processes could account for lithium's prophylactic results. Similarities exist between the action of lithium and calcium antagonists like verapamil and nimodipine. From these considerations the hypothesis emerge that calcium antagonists could be an alternative pharmacological agent in the maintenance treatment of bipolar illness. Calcium antagonists have been found useful in this indication by a number of investigators. Given the safety and relative lack of side effects of calcium channel blocking agents, their potential efficacy in mood disorders, it is concluded that calcium antagonists may be an alternative choice in prophylactic treatment for bipolar illness, especially in patients who cannot be treated with lithium or carbamazepine. There is evidence for using verapamil at 240 to 320 mg a day, in 2 to 4 times. Some studies suggest that the association of lithium with calcium antagonist resulted more effective than lithium alone or calcium antagonist alone in the reduction of episodes of affective disorders. However, concomitant administration of a calcium channel antagonist and lithium present adverse interactions (lithium toxicity, cardiovascular accidents), probably because of synergistic toxic effects. Therefore, authors advise care in monitoring patients receiving the combination of these medications.}

   Abstract={The aim this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of DHP calcium channel antagonist-nifedipine in human AWS in comparison to conventional treatment with chlordiazepoxide. Fifty nine hospitalized alcoholics of both sexes with diagnosis of AWS according to DSM-III-R criteria were treated for 2 weeks in monotherapy with nifedipine (Cordafen-Polfa)-60 mg/d. or with chlordiazepoxide (Elenium-Polfa)-150 mg/d. Evaluation of AWS symptoms was performed at baseline and after 3, 7, 14 days using Sandowal-Wang scale. Our original scales (37 items) were designed for measuring the depth of dependence (WGU) and the velocity of dependence syndrome appearance (WWO). The results show that both groups were similar regarding WGU and WWO before treatment. Both drugs caused an improvement of AWS symptoms after 3 and 7 days lasting till the end of hospitalization. Nifedipine was well tolerated and no side effects were observed or reported. The group and multidimensional analyses were performed using original computer program. The patients were divided into 3 subgroups. Comparison of mean values of improvement index between both drugs in those subgroups of patients according to WGU criteria, revealed that nifedipine was more effective on the 3-rd and 7-th day in 3 groups and 2 groups resp. According to WWO criteria the improvement index was significantly higher on the 3-rd and 7-th day in two groups whereas in one group chlordiazepoxide and nifedipine action was equal. The proposed method of group and multidimensional analysis enable us to compare the effectiveness of different kinds of AWS treatment. It is an useful aid of choosing the best drug treatment for a new patient.}

   Abstract={The reduced cardiac toxicity of the dextro-(d-) stereoisomer of verapamil (dexverapamil; Knoll Pharmaceuticals, Whippany, NJ) warrants its study as a potential multidrug-resistance (MDR) reversal agent.\\ Twenty-three patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were treated with vinblastine at a dose of 0.11 mg/kg intravenous (IV) bolus injection on days 1 and 2 every 21 days. Dexverapamil was added to subsequent cycles after resistance had been demonstrated. Dexverapamil treatment was begun 18 hours before day 1 of vinblastine administration and was given orally every 6 hours for 12 doses. Patients in group A were treated with a dose of 120 mg/m2, and those in group B were treated with 180 mg/m2 plus dexamethasone; plasma concentrations achieved in patients were correlated with in vitro effects.\\ Toxicities included hypotension, asymptomatic bradycardia, and mild atrioventricular conduction delays, although one patient had dexverapamil discontinued for grade IV congestive heart failure. There were no partial or complete responses. The mean day-1 serum dexverapamil plus norverapamil plasma concentrations were 2,575 ng/mL (range, 697 to 6,015 ng/mL) for group A and 1,654 ng/mL (range, 710 to 4,132 ng/mL) for group B at the time of vinblastine administration. These concentrations were in the range of those that reversed vinblastine resistance in vitro.\\ The advantage of dexverapamil as an MDR reversal agent is its potential for achieving desired blood levels with substantially less toxicity than the racemic mixture of verapamil. Based on tolerability, it is a suitable drug for further study in clinical trials of malignancies other than RCC that attempt to achieve MDR reversal. The dose of 120 mg/m2 given orally every 6 hours, with dose escalation based on individual tolerance, represents a feasible schedule to be considered for such studies.}

Endothelin infusion alone increased plasma endothelin from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 8.8 +/- 1.0 pmol/L (P < .05). Blood pressure rose by approximately 6 mm Hg (P < .05). Renal function changes were relatively large: Renal blood flow decreased from 941 +/- 76 to 729 +/- 118 mL/min (P < .05) and glomerular filtration rate from 105 +/- 9 to 92 +/- 10 mL/min (P < .05); renal vascular resistance increased from 101 +/- 7 to 152 +/- 20 mm Hg.min/L (P < .05); and sodium excretion decreased from 158 +/- 54 to 86 +/- 27 mumol/min (P < .05). Enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure from 94 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 3 mm Hg (P < .05) and prevented the hypertensive response to endothelin. By contrast, despite renal predilatation, endothelin reduced renal blood flow strongly (from 1063 +/- 127 to 763 +/- 100 mL/min, P < .05), although maximal renal vascular resistance was numerically lower (124 +/- 11 mm Hg.min/L) than during endothelin alone (P < .05). Glomerular filtration rate fell from 118 +/- 11 to 108 +/- 11 mL/min (P < .05). Enalapril did not alter the antinatriuretic effect of endothelin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

   Abstract={The effects of the calcium channel blockers diltiazem on the parasympathetic nervous system were studied by using spectral analysis of heart rate variability, and were compared with the effects of the beta-receptor blocker metoprolol. The area under the curve of the high-frequency range (f = 0.18-0.35 Hz) during controlled respiratory rate (f = 0.25 Hz) was used as a quantitative index of parasympathetic activity. Twenty-four male patients with proven coronary artery disease and normal left ventricular function (LVEF > 60%) were studied 2 weeks after chronic treatment with diltiazem (3 x 60 mg daily) or metoprolol (3 x 50 mg daily) before and after administration of the drug. Twelve patients received diltiazem and 12 patients metoprolol. After administration of diltiazem the peripheral systolic blood pressure was reduced, but the parasympathetic activity was significantly higher than compared with the initial measurement. The same effect was seen for metoprolol, but a significant lower heart rate was present after administration. The relative area under the high-frequency range significantly increased at rest, by 110% after diltiazem and 70% after metoprolol. Diltiazem and metoprolol enhance the vagal influence at the heart, thereby leading to an enhancement of barosensitivity and of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This action may contribute to the beneficial effects of both drugs in patients with coronary artery disease.}

Twenty-one normotensive subjects (9 female, 12 male) served as a control group. During an oral glucose tolerance test the hypertensive subjects had higher blood glucose and serum insulin levels than the controls. The hypertensive patients also showed higher triglyceride concentrations and a more abdominal pattern of body fat distribution. In addition, the women with essential hypertension exhibited a higher free androgen index (32.2 +/- 14.8 vs 20.1 +/- 15.0%, p < 0.05) than the women of the control group. After a 3 to 6 month treatment period with nifedipine or nitrendipine the elevated blood pressure of the hypertensives was significantly reduced. In a second glucose tolerance test carried out in 13 patients blood glucose, serum insulin and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower compared to the pretreatment period. The other metabolic and hormonal variables remained unchanged.\\ This observation raises the question, whether a long-term vasodilatating antihypertensive therapy can improve the metabolic abnormalities found in patients with essential hypertension.}

   Abstract={Left ventricular (LV) filling was studied in 18 healthy subjects and 19 mildly hypertensive patients before and after 50% and 70% of maximal supine exercise using radionuclide ventriculography. In addition, in the hypertensive patients, the effects of oral verapamil and lisinopril treatment on LV filling before and after exercise were studied. At rest, hypertensive patients compared with healthy subjects had a lower peak filling rate, ratio of peak filling to peak emptying rate, first-half filling fraction, and a longer isovolumic duration. With exercise, LV filling measures were not different between healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. In the hypertensive patients at rest, compared with before treatment, lisinopril prolonged isovolumic duration and verapamil had no effect on LV filling; at 50% maximal exercise compared with before treatment, verapamil shortened the time to peak filling rate and isovolumic duration and increased first-half filling fraction but, at 70% maximal exercise, verapamil had no effect, whereas lisinopril did not alter exercise LV filling at either exercise level. Thus, the early abnormal LV filling in mildly hypertensive patients is influenced by therapeutic interventions both at rest and with exercise.}

   Abstract={To compare the hemodynamic, antiischemic, metabolic, and neurohumoral effects of intravenous esmolol (beta 1 blocking agent) and gallopamil (verapamil-like calcium channel blocker), 14 patients with angiographically proven CAD and reproducible ST segment depression were studied at rest and during exercise under control conditions and after an intravenous bolus injection of esmolol (0.5 mg/kg/1 min, followed by an infusion with 0.2 mg/kg/min) or gallopamil (0.025 mg/kg/3 min). In contrast to gallopamil, esmolol significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (175.7 vs. 160 mm Hg) and heart rate (107.4 vs. 96.9 min-1) during exercise as well as cardiac output (11.57 vs. 9.38 l/min) and significantly enhanced systemic vascular resistance both at rest (1241 vs. 1479 dynes.s.cm-5) and during exercise (805 vs. 947 dynes.s.cm-5). On the other hand, exercise filling pressures and lactate levels (3.66 vs. 3.05 mmol/l) were significantly reduced by gallopamil only. Thus, the significant improvement of exercise tolerance by both esmolol and gallopamil is based on different mechanisms of action: esmolol improves myocardial ischemia by appreciably reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, whereas gallopamil primarily improves oxygen supply and ventricular performance. Plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor, and aldosterone levels as well as plasma renin activity were identically influenced by esmolol and gallopamil, respectively. A reflex activation of the sympathetic system did not occur.}

   Abstract={The aim of the study was to evaluate chronic treatment with Cordafen (nifedipine) in the out-patients over 60 years of age with established arterial hypertension. Out of 100 out-patients aged 60-83 years 69 subjects completed one-year study. The main reasons of drop-outs were: lack of patient compliance (12%), severe side effects (11%), ineffective monotherapy (5%) and other (3%). Less severe adverse effects were found in further 20 subjects. After one-year therapy hematological and biochemical parameters of the homeostasis did not deteriorate except an increase in alkaline phosphatase. Regular drug intake in a dose of 20-80 mg/daily (mean = 46.0) produced a significant decrease in the blood pressure level and an improvement of cardiac function indices (CO nad EF). In contrast Cordafen did not reduce the differences between extreme blood pressure values recorded automatically, and it did not produce a significant regression of left ventricular mass and cardiac arrhythmias. Nifedipine in mild or moderate hypertension in the elderly patient any be an adequate form of monotherapy in about 70% of them. Higher motivation for treatment in this age group and better drug tolerance may further improve this efficacy.}

   Abstract={The effect of two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, lisinopril and captopril, on proteinuria and renal haemodynamics was investigated in 11 hypertensives (9 men, 2 women; mean age 46 +/- 16 years) with proteinuria (> 1.5 g/24 h) due to chronic glomerulonephritis and impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate < 75 ml/min). In a randomized and double-blind cross-over trial the patients received, each time for six weeks, either lisinopril (5 mg/d, sometimes increased to 10 mg/d after 3 weeks) or captopril (twice daily 12.5 mg, sometimes increased to twice 25 mg after 3 weeks). Initially and between the individual treatment phases they were on a placebo phase for 4 weeks. The following were measured: protein excretion, including fractional clearance of albumin and IgG, plasma-renin activity and renal haemodynamics. Protein excretion was not significantly reduced by either drug (placebo: 7.1 +/- 4.0 g/d; lisinopril: 5.1 +/- 2.8 g/d; captopril: 5.4 +/- 3.0 g/d). Albumin excretion and fractional albumin clearance were significantly decreased only by lisinopril (P < 0.05), not by captopril. Plasma-renin activity was increased more by lisinopril than captopril (Placebo: 1.0 +/- 0.9 ng/ml.h; lisinopril: 5.2 +/- 2.8 ng/ml.h [P < 0.05]; captopril: 1.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml.h [P < 0.05]). The renal haemodynamics was only slightly influenced by either drug, but captopril significantly decreased the filtration fraction in the presence of chronic glomerulonephritis and renal failure. - Resulting from their influence on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ACE inhibitors have, in addition to their known action on renal haemodynamics, an independent effect on the loading barrier of the basal membrane of the kidney.}

   Abstract={There is evidence that calcium antagonists may have a beneficial effect on cyclosporin A (CyA)-induced hypertension after organ transplantation. In a double-blind controlled trial, 50 consecutive non-diabetic first kidney-transplant recipients were randomized to receive either isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, or placebo. There were no significant differences in age, weight, gender, warm and cold ischaemic periods, and original renal disease between treatment groups. Treatment was started intravenously 2 h before the transplantation procedure and was subsequently continued orally for 3 months. The immunosuppressive treatment included oral CyA from day 5 after a short course of anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulins. Hypertension was treated with oral labetolol in combination with guanfacine if necessary. Antihypertensive medication was prescribed significantly more often (16 vs 7 patients; p < 0.05) in the placebo group. Standing systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the isradipine group. The standing diastolic and both systolic and diastolic sitting blood pressures were similar in both groups. After 3 months, patients' mean serum creatinine was significantly lower with isradipine than with placebo (142.0 +/- 11.9 vs 164.0 +/- 10.8 mumol/l; p < 0.05). With isradipine, a significantly higher dose of CyA was needed to achieve adequate plasma levels (8.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/day; p < 0.01). It can be concluded that isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent after kidney transplantation and may have an influence on CyA metabolism. Furthermore, isradipine appears to ameliorate CyA-induced nephropathy.}

   Abstract={Calcium channel blockers have a negative inotropic effect and protract the relaxation of the normal myocardium. These effects may vary in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and with the different kinds of calcium antagonists. In the present study we therefore compared the hemodynamic effects of intravenously given equihypotensive dosages of diltiazem (D) and nisoldipine (N) in patients with CAD.\\ Each group contained 10 patients. After administration of a bolus of 300 micrograms/kg (D) and 5 micrograms/kg (N) respectively and following continuous infusion of 5.4 micrograms/kg/min (D) and 0.2 micrograms/kg/min (N) respectively, the mean arterial pressure was reduced by 15.5 +/- 6.0 (D) and 16.6 +/- 4.1 (N) mm Hg. Atrial pacing was performed in all patients to avoid reflectory heart rate effects. The pulmonary artery pressure decreased slightly with both drugs, whereas the cardiac index increased only with the use of N from 3.44 l/min x m2 to 3.93 l/min x m2. A significant change in the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt max) as an index for inotropy was not detected for N or for D. The parameters of the diastolic function (the time constant of ventricular relaxation (tau) and the maximum rate of left ventricular isovolumic pressure decline (dP/dt min)) also did not indicate unequivocal drug effects. Doppler echocardiography of the mitral valve flow was performed simultaneously with invasive pressure measurements. The flow propagation derived from the color-M-mode correlated significantly with tau and was slightly improved by D.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

   Abstract={The present study was designed to test if prophylactic intravenous nifedipine or nitroglycerine could reduce myocardial damage after cardiopulmonary bypass. 45 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were divided at random into three groups: Group 1: control; group 2: nifedipine (0.25 microgram/kg/min); group 3: nitroglycerine (1.5 micrograms/kg/min). Infusion period reached from the beginning of anaesthesia until crossclamp of the aorta. Myocardial damage was estimated by troponin T (TnT), CK-MB and ST-segment analysis of the ECG. TnT is a cardiospecific protein from the contractile apparatus of striated muscle cells. TnT-levels might provide a very sensitive marker of small amounts of cardiac muscle necrosis. It was tested with an ELISA/one-step sandwich-assay with streptavidin-technology [9]. Criteria for ischemia in the ST-segment analysis were (according to Smith et al. [19]): ST-depression > 1 mm from baseline or ST-elevation > 2 mm from baseline at J-point + 60 ms. Statistical interpretation was done by one- and two-factorial analyses of variance (including multivariate analyses of variance). Correlation between two variables was tested by regression analysis. A level of p < 0.05 was taken for indicating statistical significance. Biometrical data, circulation data and data from cardiopulmonary bypass were without significant differences among all groups (Tables 1 and 2). Starting from normal values (< 0.05 ng/ml) TnT significantly rose in all groups immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and remained elevated until the forth day after operation (values between 0.4 and 0.6 microgram/ml) (Figure 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

This trial is a prospective randomized open blinded-endpoint (PROBE) multicenter, parallel-group study conducted in Norway and Sweden. The study is designed to evaluate the potential preventive effects of diltiazem compared with conventional antihypertensive drug treatment. Primary endpoints are cardiovascular mortality defined as fatal acute myocardial infarction, fatal acute cerebrovascular disease (stroke), sudden death and other fatal cardiovascular disease as well as cardiovascular morbidity defined as myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). Secondary endpoints are total mortality, the development or deterioration of ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attacks, diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency. Male and female patients, aged 50-69, with primary hypertension are randomly allocated to therapy starting with either diltiazem (180-360 mg daily) or conventional treatment (diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers). Add-on therapy in the conventional treatment group excludes all types of calcium antagonists. The goal of treatment will be a target diastolic blood pressure of < or = 90 mmHg or a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction. The NORDIL study will allow the detection of a 20% difference in cardiovascular mortality between the two groups with a power of 80% at the 5% significance level (two-sided test). A total of 12,000 patients will be recruited from about 480 primary Health Care Centers or hospital based Hypertension Units. Patients will be treated for an average period of 5 years.}

Nine patients received 0.4 units/min of vasopressin and 9 patients received the same dose of vasopressin plus 0.3 mg/min of nicardipine for 40 min. Vasopressin plus nicardipine induced a significant reduction in both free portal venous pressure and the portal venous pressure gradient. These effects were similar to the changes with vasopressin alone (-14% vs. -16% in free portal venous pressure; -29% vs. -31% in portal venous pressure gradient). Vasopressin decreased both hepatic blood flow (-34%, P < 0.01) and intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green (-22%, P < 0.05). In contrast, these two parameters did not significantly change after vasopressin plus nicardipine (-8% and -3%, respectively).
